<small>A NEW HOME</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Sitting</span> on the doorstep, Elizabeth Scott leaned
her head against the stone wall of the old house.
The June twilight was closing in and a hard day&#8217;s
work was done. Three meals had been prepared
and half of the large garden had been hoed and
weeded. Feeling that their gardening knowledge
was limited, Elizabeth and her brother made up
by an excess of cultivation.</p>

<p>A tall, slender boy came round the corner of
the house and called &#8220;Elizabeth!&#8221; There was a
dependent quality in his voice; one would have
guessed that he was a good deal younger and a
good deal less enterprising than the sister whom
he addressed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Herbert!&#8221; Elizabeth looked up smilingly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
Her voice was soft like his, but the words
were briskly and firmly spoken. Briskness and
firmness were two of Elizabeth&#8217;s most noticeable
qualities. Those who opposed her called her firmness
stubbornness.</p>

<p>There was another quality expressed in her
voice&mdash;an intense affection for the brother
whom she addressed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you going to bed, Elizabeth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet. Come and sit down.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herbert dropped to the doorstep beside his
sister. His motions still showed the effect of a
long illness from which he had not entirely recovered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you very tired, Herbert?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not very.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a long time both were quiet. The old
house seemed gradually to sink into the woodland
which rose behind it against the wall of the
higher mountains, the shadows of night crept
over the miles of fields and orchards which
dropped to the distant plain, the garden between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
the house and the road was blotted out,
and the old oak trees on the other side came
closer and closer. In the woods whip-poor-wills
called, and once an owl flapped low above the
doorstep. At that Herbert started and Elizabeth
spoke reassuringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing but an owl, dear! He looked like a
great moth, didn&#8217;t he? Herbert, when we can,
we must restore the old driveway. It used to
come in from the road in a beautiful curve to the
door. Then the garden can be moved, and I believe
if we&#8217;d cut away that clump of poor trees
we could sit here on our own doorstep and see
Gettysburg. Think of it, Herbert!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Herbert. His voice expressed
pleasure, but a qualified pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t make it seem <i>real</i>,&#8221; said Elizabeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we can only succeed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course we shall succeed!&#8221; Any one listening
to Elizabeth would have said &#8220;Of course!&#8221;
&#8220;In the first place, we have this house, blessed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
substantial old thing that it is, only occasionally
occupied during forty years and yet habitable
after a little mending of the roof. John Baring&#8217;s
character can be seen in the way he built
his house. I&#8217;m more proud of him every day.
Then we have the acres and acres of woodland
behind us, and our garden&mdash;think of the
produce we have to sell to-morrow! And soon
we shall have our orchard,&mdash;<i>our</i> orchard, Herbert.
They say that men within a few miles have
sold a single crop for ten thousand dollars. It
will mean work and saving and then comfort for
all our lives. Why, we are the most fortunate
people in the world!&#8221;</p>

<p>Herbert looked back over his shoulder into
the dark hall. At the other end a door opened
against the black wall of the woodland.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t it make you nervous to think of
those men prowling round with their guns and
dogs?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all. They&#8217;ll have to be warned away.
I suppose they&#8217;re so used to roaming about that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
they think the place is theirs. I&#8217;m not so much
afraid of them as I am of their big dogs running
over the garden.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that noise, Elizabeth?&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth listened intently. Herbert often
heard alarming noises. There was a soft rustle
of leaves near at hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;A deer, I guess,&#8221; she answered cheerfully,
&#8220;or some other wild thing&mdash;nothing to hurt us,
I&#8217;m sure. I cannot see why our people ever went
away from here. Grandfather Baring was a man
of standing&mdash;why, this must have been the finest
place for miles around! Wait till we have a
new portico and a little paint on the woodwork
and some shrubbery! I should think mother
would have been continually homesick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did she ever say she was?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. When I asked her she used to tell me
what she remembered hearing people say about
the battle. She was not a talkative person.
But all these years the taxes have been paid and
there wasn&#8217;t even always a renter.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>&#8220;Do you think she believed we should ever
come back? Do you&mdash;&#8221; Herbert interrupted
himself. &#8220;There is some one looking at us
now!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a man at the edge of the woods with
a big dog and a gun!&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth turned her head. The moon had
risen and its rays shone on a long object of
bright steel. This object was not pointed in the
direction of the two on the doorstep; it slanted
backward from the shoulder which supported it,
but it was none the less menacing.</p>

<p>Elizabeth sprang up, a short, somewhat
stocky, swiftly moving figure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, neighbor!&#8221; she said loudly. &#8220;How are
you this evening?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man drew back into the shadows, but he
was not to be allowed to slink away. Elizabeth
went closer to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you a neighbor?&#8221; she persisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not close,&#8221; was the sullen answer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>&#8220;Have you lived about here a long time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Bout&#8217;s long as I&#8217;ve lived anywhere.&#8221; It was
impossible to tell whether this was a humorous
way of saying that he had lived here always, or
whether it was meant to indicate that he was a
wanderer.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are going to stay here,&#8221; went on Elizabeth.
&#8220;After a while when our orchard is set out,
we shall need a good deal of help. Could you give
us a hand sometimes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know any one who could?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We really belong here,&#8221; explained Elizabeth
pleasantly.</p>

<p>The stranger seemed startled.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This was our grandfather&#8217;s place. We were
born in the West, but our people are gone, and
so we have come back. We&#8217;re going to raise
apples. The fields in front of the house are to
be turned into an orchard.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>It seemed that the stranger could take in but
one thought at a time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your gran&#8217;paw lived here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What mought &#8217;a&#8217; been his name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;John Baring was his name. Did you ever
hear of him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard of him.&#8221; The answer, begun near at
hand, receded into the shadows, as man and dog
disappeared.</p>

<p>Elizabeth returned to the doorstep.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told him our pedigree and our intentions.
If he had stayed a little longer, I should have
told him to keep out of our woodland. Now, my
dear, it&#8217;s time for bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herbert rose stiffly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything is ready, isn&#8217;t it, Elizabeth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, everything; the onions and the radishes
and the lettuce and the peas.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t it make you a little uncomfortable
to think of going about peddling things from
door to door to strange people?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>&#8220;Not a bit! It&#8217;s just as honorable to sell onions
as diamonds or books. I&#8217;m so proud of my
garden sass, I&#8217;d drive to the gate of the White
House and offer it there. And I don&#8217;t mean my
patrons to be strangers, I mean them to be
friends. It&#8217;s quite time that we made acquaintances.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herbert sighed as he went into the house.
Elizabeth stood for a while looking at the illuminated
landscape and thinking, not of the morrow
or of the menacing gun, but of a deeper source
of anxiety. Would Herbert never get well and
grow up to be a man? She did not mind hard
work, but she wished now to share responsibility.
He was anxious to do his part, but he was
like a child, requiring direction and encouragement.</p>

<p>It was well that the wagon was already packed
with the produce which Elizabeth meant to
offer, because in the morning she had but one
thought&mdash;she would see the battle-field of
Gettysburg. Her curiosity had been only half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
gratified by her mother&#8217;s answers to her questions
and her meager accounts in her school histories
had told her little more. She meant to try
to find books which described the battle, so that
looking from her doorstep she should be able to
picture to herself in detail the conflict which,
she believed, had saved her country. She was
intensely patriotic; long ago she had hung from
one of the upper windows of the old house a
little flag.</p>

<p>The brother and sister spoke but seldom as
they drove down the hills. The morning was
clear and bright, they were young, and a great
adventure awaited them. It seemed to Elizabeth
that each old farmhouse must have some patriotic
significance, that each old tree could tell
tales of valor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I knew what had happened on this
road!&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>Herbert shivered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you suppose there was <i>fighting</i> here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very likely,&#8221; said Elizabeth. &#8220;There&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
got to be fighting,&#8221; she went on a little impatiently.
&#8220;Everything we have has been fought
and suffered for, Herbert. Why, look!&#8221;</p>

<p>She pulled the old horse up and climbing out
of the wagon went to the side of the road.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is a marker with an inscription on it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Even Herbert showed interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think Joe&#8217;ll stand?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Either that or he&#8217;ll lie down,&#8221; answered
Elizabeth gayly. &#8220;He won&#8217;t run, that&#8217;s certain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Together the two read the inscription:</p>

<p class="center">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>Then they climbed silently back into the
wagon.</p>

<p>A few miles farther on more elaborate monuments
greeted their eager eyes, a Union general
on horseback and a Union officer, booted and
spurred, standing with field-glasses in hand,
looking earnestly and inquiringly toward the
west from which Elizabeth and Herbert had
come.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Confederates must have come by our
house!&#8221; said Herbert.</p>

<p>At the brow of the next hill they saw Gettysburg,
spread before them. Beyond another rise
they could see white marble shafts. To the right
a tall building lifted its cupola above the trees of
a thick grove.</p>

<p>&#8220;This must be the Seminary,&#8221; said Elizabeth.
&#8220;You remember there was a Seminary Ridge!&#8221;</p>

<p>Old Joe traveled slowly down the leafy avenue
and at the first house stopped of his own accord.
He had been a huckster&#8217;s horse, a fact
which accounted for various peculiarities.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>Elizabeth went into the yard and offered her
wares to a lady on the porch. She had looked
at Herbert hopefully, but he made no sign of
intending to act as agent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-morning. Do you need any vegetables?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; answered the lady. &#8220;I shall be
glad to have vegetables. Now that we have a
curb market in the town, no one stops here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have onions and peas and lettuce and
radishes.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lady came out to inspect the wares.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re fine! I&#8217;ll have some of each.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the bargain was complete, Elizabeth,
in friendly fashion, told who she was. The
crisp bill in her hand was an earnest of future
success.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our grandfather was John Baring who lived
in one of the old houses between here and
Chambersburg. It stands a little back from the
road on the first steep hill above Cashtown.
Perhaps you&#8217;ve seen it?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>The lady did not say. She looked curiously at
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;We mean to live there and raise apples. We
came early in the spring and planted our garden
and it has grown splendidly. You are our first
customer. When would you like another supply?
The day after to-morrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>The lady hesitated. Her expression had
changed. Then she began to speak rapidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a curb market, you know. I don&#8217;t
know whether you will find much business.
Many people have their own gardens.&#8221; She
seemed to realize the contradiction between her
first enthusiasm and this deterring advice, for
she no longer looked at Elizabeth. &#8220;Perhaps you
had better try to sell your produce at Chambersburg.&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth was mystified and a little hurt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said she as she climbed back
into the wagon.</p>

<p>She stopped at the next house and the next.
At both, before she offered her wares she told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
her name and her grandfather&#8217;s name. She sold
nothing, however, in spite of her friendliness. It
could not be possible that her friendliness repelled
these people!</p>

<p>From the porch of one large house a kindly
old gentleman walked to meet her, book in
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thank you,&#8221; he said before she had time
to speak. &#8220;We have a garden. But you have fine-looking
vegetables and I wish you luck.&#8221;</p>

<p>He even waved his hand as they drove away.
Elizabeth liked him because of his smile and she
wished that she might stop and talk to him; he
would probably know all about the battle.</p>

<p>As for the old gentleman, he liked Elizabeth
and spoke of her to his family. &#8220;A capable-looking
soul, not pretty, exactly, but with unexpectedly
blue eyes. She looked like an interesting
girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Sherlock Holmes,&#8221; said the old gentleman&#8217;s
daughter. &#8220;How did you make that out?
You are always finding interesting persons.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>&#8220;From the way she looked at the book which
I had in my hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth made no more sales. In the end she
disposed of the remainder of her goods at a store
and turned Joe&#8217;s head homeward. Herbert was
depressed by their bad luck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps it is all a mistake!&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth slapped the lines on Joe&#8217;s back.
Unconsciously she had taken them from Herbert
and as unconsciously he had handed them
to her. It was too late now to return them, but
the next responsibility, however great or small,
Herbert must shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it isn&#8217;t a mistake! They were just
supplied, that is all. We&#8217;ll go on a day when
there is no curb market.&#8221;</p>

<p>In encouraging Herbert, she forgot her own
disturbance of mind. &#8220;We have ten dollars, at
any rate, and that is as good as found.&#8221;</p>

<p>The June afternoon had grown cool; as the
two drove across the grass to the doorway of the
stone house the shadows of the mountain lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
darkly about them. The house looked larger; it
might have appeared, to one who did not love it,
sinister. In the stone above the door the name
John Baring was deeply carved; it seemed to
Elizabeth suddenly to have no relation to her;
it looked strange as even familiar words may
look at times. But she spoke in her usual soft,
brisk tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow we&#8217;ll try Chambersburg. It is so
much larger and there will not be so many gardens.
Stable your war-horse, Herbert, and I&#8217;ll
make waffles for supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth went into her room, originally a
sitting-room behind the larger parlor with windows
opening toward the woods. On the floor
lay a piece of paper which had not been there
when she went away. She picked it up and
carried it to the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;What in the world!&#8221; she cried. With difficulty
she deciphered the awkward writing.</p>


<p class="center">This ant no place to rase apels. Nor yit for
those what are kin to John Baring.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>As if to add the last touch of melodrama to
his warning, the author had executed a sketch
of what was intended to be a skull and cross-bones.</p>

<p>Elizabeth looked at the paper and turned it
over. After a while she heard the sound of Herbert&#8217;s
footsteps and knew that in a second she
would hear the familiar &#8220;Elizabeth!&#8221; This was
not a responsibility to be shared with frightened
Herbert. She laid the paper under the scarf on
her bureau and crossed the hall to the kitchen,
and there, as she moved about gathering her
materials for supper, she had astonished and
bitter thoughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t make friends with the neighbors at
first because I thought they might feel under
obligations to help us! I thought that was the
Eastern way!&#8221; She looked out into the darkening
woods. &#8220;This is a polite neighborhood into
which we have moved!&#8221; said she.</p>

<small>&#8220;WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH US?&#8221;</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Chambersburg</span> is a much larger town than
Gettysburg, and to Elizabeth, who had bought
her supplies there when she and Herbert had arrived
in the early spring, it seemed now to promise
more patrons. She would still be interested
in Gettysburg and wished to learn all she could
about the battle, but her relations with the town
would henceforth be those of a tourist.</p>

<p>When morning dawned, she began to wonder
whether Gettysburg&#8217;s rudeness was not a product
of her own imagination.</p>

<p>&#8220;No town is going to hang out banners
because Elizabeth Scott has arrived to sell
onions!&#8221; said she to herself.</p>

<p>Of the paper found upon the floor she said
nothing to Herbert. The whole incident seemed
fantastic. It was silly to have been disturbed for
an instant. The sign of the skull and cross-bones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
as an impelling threat had no longer any power,
at least it should have none over Elizabeth
Scott. It was doubtless the man with the gun
who had thus favored her. Besides, she declined
to be frightened by any man who spelled apples,
&#8220;apels.&#8221;</p>

<p>The distance to Chambersburg is longer than
the distance to Gettysburg and the hills are
steep. But the morning sunlight slanted through
the trees, the birds sang, laurel bloomed everywhere,
and there was a succession of sweet odors,
many of which Elizabeth could not identify. The
woods were for the most part still virgin and into
their depths an occasional road or path invited.</p>

<p>In an open place they passed a park with pavilions
and swings, where a queer old ruin which
seemed the work of a fire stood against a hillside.
It was not the ruin of a house or barn; it was
difficult to tell what it was.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to find out,&#8221; said Elizabeth. &#8220;I&#8217;m
going to learn all about this mountain. Perhaps
this place was burned when Chambersburg was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
burned. That was a year after the battle of Gettysburg&mdash;that
is, I think it was. It&#8217;s hard to
realize that there was fighting here or anything
else but peace and happiness. As I remember,
people had to flee from the fire for their lives.
I suppose it&#8217;s hard to forgive things like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>She drove through the eastern part of the town
and into the busy square, then she turned to the
right. After she had driven several blocks, she
began to offer her wares. As at Gettysburg, the
beginning was propitious. The first purchaser
asked whether they were newcomers, and Elizabeth
told happily their history.</p>

<p>&#8220;We lived in the West, but after our mother
died, we decided to come back to our grandfather&#8217;s
place and raise apples. My brother and
I are alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is your grandfather&#8217;s place?&#8221; asked
the lady kindly.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the road to Gettysburg.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was your grandfather&#8217;s name? I know
many families on that road.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>&#8220;His name was John Baring. The house
which he built in 1860 is still standing and in
good condition and we live there. We&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The stranger seemed to be indifferent to what
Elizabeth had to say further.</p>

<p>&#8220;What name did you say?&#8221; she asked
sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;John Baring.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lady&#8217;s lips parted and a brilliant red appeared
upon her cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;You would much better have stayed in the
West!&#8221; said she sharply. &#8220;You made a great
mistake to come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth stared. She had brought the woman&#8217;s
order in from the wagon in a basket. Now,
without taking out the articles, she lifted the
basket and started toward the street.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean that I wouldn&#8217;t buy your
things this time, especially as I have ordered
them!&#8221; came a loud protest.</p>

<p>Elizabeth made no answer. She went out of
the gate and closed it carefully behind her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>&#8220;Let us drive on quickly, Herbert!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a crazy woman in there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did she say?&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth&#8217;s hot anger gave place to a keener
feeling of alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing worth repeating.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we stop at other places?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth now treated her customers with
peremptory shortness and the method seemed
to pay.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you buy, buy quickly, but it really doesn&#8217;t
make any difference to me whether you buy or
not.&#8221; Thus said Elizabeth&#8217;s bright blue eyes. It
seemed that a new Elizabeth had come out from
the rude woman&#8217;s gate.</p>

<p>But Herbert could not long be kept in ignorance.
They turned and drove back, offering the
remainder of their wares on the other side of the
street. When they reached the house opposite
that of the first purchaser, Elizabeth had approached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
the porch steps before she saw that the
woman had crossed the street and sat with her
neighbor. The neighbor rose as Elizabeth drew
near.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought not to come here,&#8221; she declared.
&#8220;If people knew who you were no one would buy
from you.&#8221; The voice was not angry; it was earnest
and kindly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you understand that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you need any vegetables?&#8221; asked Elizabeth
with burning cheeks. Whatever this strange
mystery was, she was determined not to have it
explained on the public street.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t need any vegetables.&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth turned and went out. Herbert
looked shrunken.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did the woman across the street speak to
you like that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Something like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do they mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no idea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it our name that angers them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, Herbert.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>&#8220;Can you account for it in any way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did mother ever say that anything dreadful
had happened in our family?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She was a sad sort of woman. Could anything
have worried her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never suspected anything.&#8221; When the
words were out, Elizabeth remembered long
periods of depression.</p>

<p>&#8220;She never warned us not to come here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She never thought of our coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall we do now, Elizabeth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am considering that.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not until they had left Chambersburg
far behind and had reached again the little park,
that Elizabeth spoke. She lifted her head suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Elizabeth, have you a plan?&#8221; It was a question
often asked by her brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I have a plan. To-morrow I am going
to Gettysburg and I am going to call upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
old gentleman and ask him what is the matter
with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The old gentleman with the book?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why are you going to ask him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because he is old and kind and because he
probably knows all about the neighborhood. We
seem to have some kind of a bar sinister on our
escutcheon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herbert looked sidewise at Elizabeth. Thank
fortune she could still joke!</p>

<p>&#8220;If we committed murder or theft or any
other base crime, I want to know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Elizabeth!&#8221; protested Herbert. Then he
asked a little faintly, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you want me to go
with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth&#8217;s eyes hardened. She had thought,
of course, that Herbert would go with her.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; it isn&#8217;t necessary. There is a great deal
to be done at home and Joe will travel better
with a light load.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rising early, she called Herbert. The sun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
was up; it gilded the boles of the trees and
turned the spider&#8217;s webs to silver. If the old
house had been a beautiful belle, one might have
said that the morning was her hour. The sunlight
fell upon the fine, severe old façade, showing
all its sturdy strength of design and workmanship
and making glitter each tiny point of
quartz in the stone.</p>

<p>But Elizabeth did not think of its beauty. She
prepared Herbert&#8217;s breakfast and also his lunch,
then she climbed once more into the wagon.</p>

<p>She did not remember until she reached the
old gentleman&#8217;s house that she did not know his
name. Fortunately he was on the porch and rose
to greet her. He was, as his daughter had said,
always finding interesting persons, and he was
also frequently disappointed in them. Few
young people, he mourned, were willing to put
their minds upon anything for any length of
time, even upon the history of their own country
and neighborhood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-morning,&#8221; he said, recalling at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
the blue eyes which he had admired. &#8220;Well, did
you sell all your wares?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Elizabeth. She proceeded at
once to the business in hand. &#8220;My name is Elizabeth
Scott. I have come to live in this neighborhood
and I wished to ask some questions about
its history.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old gentleman beamed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down, sit down! My name is Thomas,
and I am a crank about the history of this neighborhood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard some one speak on the street about
Colonel Thomas&mdash;is that you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The old gentleman nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pennsylvania is the most interesting State
in the Union and this is its most interesting
county. You will probably be sorry that you
ever made my acquaintance, because, once
started, I never stop.&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth smiled wistfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Colonel Thomas, upon whose lips volumes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
of information trembled, did not get far
into the history of the county. He saw suddenly
tears in Elizabeth&#8217;s blue eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the matter?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;My brother and I have come here to earn
our living. We were born in Illinois and there
father died when we were children. Our mother
lived until a year ago, then she died suddenly. I
had expected to teach school, but my brother&#8217;s
health failed and the doctors thought that an
entire change of climate might cure him. Mother
still owned her father&#8217;s property in this county,
so we came here, expecting to plant an orchard.
My brother is much better, even in these few
months. We have a fine garden and we have
tried to sell our things, but wherever I have gone
people have insulted me and advised me to
leave. I thought that perhaps you could tell me
what is the matter with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old colonel raised both his hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;On my life, young lady! I never heard of such
a state of affairs. This is a pleasant, hospitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
neighborhood. I was born here and have lived
here all my life and I know it. What did you say
your name is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is Elizabeth Scott. But it isn&#8217;t my
name that excites them apparently; it&#8217;s the
name of my grandfather.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was his name?&#8221;</p>

<p>It seemed to Elizabeth before she answered
that the expression of the kindly countenance
had changed. A disturbing suspicion seemed to
have entered Colonel Thomas&#8217;s mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;John Baring,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;John Baring!&#8221; repeated Colonel Thomas.
&#8220;Oh, my dear young lady! John Baring!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did he do?&#8221; asked Elizabeth steadily.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve never heard anything about him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing. My mother was a quiet woman
who spoke little about anything, but I am sure
that she respected him and loved him. What did
he do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, young lady, you have asked me a hard
question. I have a friendly feeling for you, I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>&#8220;That is the reason I came to you,&#8221; explained
Elizabeth. &#8220;You looked at me in a
friendly way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem like a young person of excellent
common sense and composure. Do you wish me
to tell you the whole truth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By all means!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you come into the house? We might be
interrupted here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; consented Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Colonel Thomas led the way to a library
whose walls were lined to the ceiling with books.
If she had been less worried, Elizabeth would
have exclaimed with delight. As it was, she gave
a long sigh.</p>

<p>Colonel Thomas took from a shelf a thick
book. Elizabeth could see on its back the title
&#8220;Recollections of a Confederate General.&#8221; Her
heart stood still. Was their disgrace printed?
What kind of disgrace could it be?</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down.&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth obeyed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>&#8220;I should decline to tell you if it weren&#8217;t inevitable
that you should know.&#8221; Even yet Colonel
Thomas hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather know it quickly, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Colonel Thomas began to speak as rapidly as
Elizabeth could wish.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was a certain fact long gossiped about
in this county. It was said that John Baring
had given the Confederates valuable aid when
they came here and that he had even guided
them a part of the way. Before that his neighbors
had never dreamed that he was anything
but loyal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it just neighborhood gossip?&#8221; asked
Elizabeth. Her cheeks were pale, but her eyes
held the old gentleman&#8217;s bravely. &#8220;Was it confirmed
in any way?&#8221;</p>

<p>Colonel Thomas opened his large book.</p>

<p>&#8220;Unfortunately a few months ago this book
was published, &#8216;The Recollections and Letters
of General Adams,&#8217; a reliable witness. He describes
the approach of Lee&#8217;s troops to Gettysburg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
and says this&#8221;&mdash;Colonel Thomas found
the place and read&mdash;&#8220;&#8216;From John Baring
we secured information about roads leading to
Gettysburg.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I see it?&#8221; asked Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Colonel Thomas laid the book on Elizabeth&#8217;s
knee. She read in silence, with bent head.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see how the neighbors felt about him.
He could not have done much harm, of course,
because there were few roads and these were
easy to find, and they could have got the information
in other ways. He went away with the
Confederate army and never came back. He was
never seen here again, but it is not impossible
that he lived for many years.&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth sat motionless.</p>

<p>&#8220;I remember now that his wife died after
some years and his daughter married a stranger
and went away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still Elizabeth did not move.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seemed kinder to tell you and prepare you
to protect yourself against rudeness. Unfortunately,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
some local editor read this book and
copied this letter and it has revived an old story
which had better been forgotten. I fought
against the Confederates, but I am willing to
forgive. Perhaps there is some other place where
you could make a home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Elizabeth. &#8220;You have
done me a very great favor.&#8221; She rose and
handed Colonel Thomas his book.</p>

<p>Colonel Thomas grew more and more disturbed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you partake of some refreshment?&#8221;
he offered in his old-fashioned way. &#8220;I will call
my daughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I thank you. I have a long journey and I
must start.&#8221; She looked up at the old gentleman
for a single brave instant; then her eyes dropped.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t be blamed for the sins and mistakes
of our ancestors,&#8221; said he unhappily.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; agreed Elizabeth. &#8220;That is true.&#8221; But
she could not fail to see that, consciously or
unconsciously, he glanced toward two old swords<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
crossed above his mantelpiece. &#8220;Good-bye,&#8221;
said she.</p>

<p>But her farewell was not final. She had driven
only a short distance when she turned old Joe
round, facing him the way he had come. Her
cheeks burned. Now she looked upon the marauders
on her land in a new light.</p>

<p>&#8220;They probably think they can do as they
please because we are despised!&#8221;</p>

<p>Colonel Thomas welcomed her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll always be glad to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come back to ask another question,
which has to do with the present instead of the
past. We have a good deal of woodland back of
the house and men prowl about there constantly
with guns and dogs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know them!&#8221; said Colonel Thomas excitedly.
&#8220;They have a settlement up in the woods.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I spoke to one of them and told him that we
had come to stay, and the next evening I found
a scrawled note directing us to leave. It was even
decorated with skull and cross-bones!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>&#8220;There&#8217;s only one of &#8217;em can write and he
learned in the penitentiary, that&#8217;s Sheldon, a
tall man with a drooping mustache. Was it he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the one I talked to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re a set of miserable rascals!&#8221; Colonel
Thomas rose and began to walk up and down.
&#8220;They&#8217;ve an interesting origin, but that&#8217;s all
about &#8217;em that is interesting. They&#8217;re descendants
of the first squatters. The Colonial Government
had a great deal of trouble with them,
and since then they&#8217;ve been against everything,
against the Government, against education,
against religion, against law. During the war
they were against the North, and the draft
couldn&#8217;t reach into the mountains far enough
to catch &#8217;em. There&#8217;s this Sheldon who served
a term for arson&mdash;I sent him up myself when I
was judge&mdash;and a heavy, short, black-bearded
man named Black Smith&mdash;don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s
&#8216;blacksmith&#8217;; there&#8217;s nothing so industrious
about &#8217;em! They all have pleasant descriptive
titles, like &#8216;Black&#8217; and &#8216;Bud&#8217; and &#8216;Bully.&#8217; But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
there&#8217;s one institution they fear and that&#8217;s the
constabulary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are the State police. If you are annoyed,
let me know and there&#8217;ll be a settlement.
The law will stand behind you there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth rose once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Colonel Thomas assured her again vehemently
that he and the law and the constabulary
would stand by her. &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t hesitate
to ask me?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was evidently a relief to the old gentleman
to be able to offer to do something for her.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; promised Elizabeth, &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t hesitate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Colonel Thomas watched her until she turned
at the top of the hill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now she has a row to hoe!&#8221; said he aloud.</p>

<small>&#8220;I WILL NOT BELIEVE IT!&#8221;</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> had a great deal of time to think on
the way home. Old Joe, who in three days had
traveled about fifty miles, could not be encouraged
beyond a slow walk. But she did not
think very connectedly. Mind and soul were
weary; her troubles presented themselves rather
as a dull, undefined pain than as a sharp anxiety.
Things could wait, she said to herself.</p>

<p>It would be necessary, of course, for her to
tell Herbert, and she trembled for the effect upon
him. She had feared for weeks that his very nature
had been affected by his illness and that he
would remain a sort of dependent child instead
of becoming a man. But what she had heard to-day
threw another light on his condition. Could
it be that it was an inherited weakness, the result
of the shame which their mother must have
felt? Their mother had been a woman of strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
will, but might it not have been that her grief
and anxiety had affected Herbert? She must
have felt her father&#8217;s act to be a disgrace&mdash;it
could not be otherwise. It was from that poor
mother that Elizabeth had learned to love her
country!</p>

<p>But not even the word of a Colonel Thomas
and the printed statement of a book could in an
hour or two alter the conscious and unconscious
convictions of Elizabeth&#8217;s life. The belief that
one has been &#8220;well-born&#8221; is not easily yielded,
even though one may have hitherto felt no conscious
satisfaction. When, at last, she turned a
weary Joe in upon the grassy drive, her lips
were set.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it,&#8221; said she stubbornly.</p>

<p>Herbert came to meet her and to take the
horse. He glanced back over his shoulder into
the woods. All day poor Herbert had been looking
over his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Elizabeth?&#8221; he asked nervously.
&#8220;What did you find out?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>&#8220;We will talk after we have had supper,&#8221;
said Elizabeth cheerfully. &#8220;You remember
mother used to say that &#8216;empty stomachs make
cowards.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; agreed Herbert.</p>

<p>Sometimes through the meal he looked at
Elizabeth uneasily, but most of the time he
seemed to be occupied with a trouble of his
own. He had had that day a peculiar kind of
anonymous communication meant for him and
he was meditating upon it.</p>

<p>When the supper dishes were put away, the
two sat down on the doorstep. The lovely
weather continued, the rising moon shone once
more over the beautiful plain, the whip-poor-wills
called mysteriously.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the home of my soul, the earthly
home at least,&#8221; said Elizabeth to herself. Then
she laid her hand on Herbert&#8217;s knee. &#8220;My dear,
things are a little worse than I imagined. I visited
the old gentleman and he tells me that our
grandfather was supposed to have helped the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Confederates when they came into this county;
he advised them, and is said also to have guided
them. This was common report about here for
many years. He disappeared with them and
never returned. I suppose this must have been
pretty well forgotten in all this time, especially
as all the family had gone away, but a little
while ago a book was published, &#8216;The Recollections
and Letters of General Adams.&#8217; This Confederate
general said that John Baring had
given them information about roads. That is
why they hate us!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t our fault!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall we do, Elizabeth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shan&#8217;t do anything right away. We&#8217;re
here and we can live even if people won&#8217;t buy
our things. Our trees are engaged and we&#8217;ll set
them out. We&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, let us go away!&#8221; cried Herbert. &#8220;We
should never be happy, we should never see anything
but scowling faces.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>&#8220;We shouldn&#8217;t make ourselves happy by
going away,&#8221; said Elizabeth. &#8220;The day would
come when we&#8217;d regret it. And at any rate we
shan&#8217;t go unless things get worse. I shan&#8217;t be
driven away whether the story is true or untrue.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think that there&#8217;s a chance that it
might not be true?&#8221; faltered Herbert.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it yet,&#8221; said Elizabeth
stoutly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not, Elizabeth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know exactly. I just don&#8217;t believe it.
I should have difficulty believing such a thing
about any living man whom I had respected, and
I&#8217;ll believe it still less about a man who is dead.
Moreover, we owe it to ourselves to follow it to
its remotest conclusion, Herbert. The possession
of ancestors who are a credit is no small possession.
But it&#8217;s like good health, we don&#8217;t value it
till it&#8217;s gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think we could make investigations
and prove it untrue?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It might be possible.&#8221; Elizabeth was pleased.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
Herbert did not often make original suggestions.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do all the work on the place,&#8221; offered
Herbert, looking uneasily over his shoulder.
&#8220;That is, if you have to go away anywhere. We
haven&#8217;t papers or records of any kind, have
we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re <i>sure</i> mother never said anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth&#8217;s brow puckered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t remember that she did. I have been
trying to think. It must have been too dreadful
to talk about and I wonder her heart didn&#8217;t
break.&#8221; Elizabeth looked back into the dark
hall as though she could see there a lonely figure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you any plan, Elizabeth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; except that I thought of hunting through
the house. Years and years have passed, but
there might be something. There might be a
nook or cranny that had escaped the renters and
that has escaped us.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>&#8220;What do you think you might find?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Elizabeth. &#8220;Now let us
go to bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next day offered itself as a suitable time
for indoor occupation. The fine weather had
broken and rain fell steadily. The plain was
gray, the woods were dim, there was all about
the sound of running water, water dripping from
the eaves and falling from the sky and running
rapidly in the brook near the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll begin in the cellar,&#8221; said Elizabeth.</p>

<p>The cellar, explored inch by inch by the aid of
lantern and candle, yielded nothing but resolutions
that it should be thoroughly whitewashed
as soon as possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can store bushels and barrels of stuff
there,&#8221; said Elizabeth as they came upstairs.
&#8220;Now the first floor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Beside the fireplace in the parlor were two
deep cupboards for wood. These had been looked
into often, but Elizabeth examined them again
and scrutinized them earnestly to be sure that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
they contained no secret compartments. But the
interior was plastered smoothly.</p>

<p>On the first floor there were no other cupboards
or closets, and the other rooms, occupied
as a kitchen and as bedrooms, had been lived
in for too many weeks to hold any secrets.</p>

<p>At the top of the first flight of stairs, Elizabeth
stood still.</p>

<p>&#8220;Herbert, this place has inexhaustible possibilities!
See these many rooms, how easily we
could make this a comfortable place for quiet
people in summer! Water could be piped down
from one of the springs. I know that gravity
alone would carry it higher than the house-top.
I wonder whether John Baring thought of
that!&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth went into the first room. It was
large and bare and offered no place of storage.
She passed into the next and there for a moment
she forgot the purpose of her search. The view
from the front door was extensive, but from the
second floor one could look over a spur of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
mountain to the right and see other miles of
rain-drenched plain.</p>

<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t anything here, Elizabeth,&#8221; said
Herbert.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, nothing. Now we&#8217;ll try the attic. That&#8217;s
the traditional hiding-place for documents.&#8221;</p>

<p>The attic was as bare as the rest of the house.
If the family had left any property there, it
had been long since removed by the successive
renters.</p>

<p>Herbert went downstairs for a candle and they
crept into the low cubby-holes under the slanting
roof. Mud wasps&#8217; nests and spider webs rewarded
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is really nothing,&#8221; said Herbert drearily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, there is!&#8221; cried Elizabeth. &#8220;Here is
writing on this beam. I can&#8217;t quite stretch to it,
Herbert. What does it say?&#8221;</p>

<p>Herbert dropped the candle from his nervous
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ll be disappointed,&#8221; said he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
after a glance. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t say anything about
the battle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does it say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It says, &#8216;I have built this house the best I
know. God bless those who go in and out.&#8217; It&#8217;s
signed &#8216;John Baring.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth stood looking up at the inscription.
Suddenly a tear rolled down her cheek.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe he was a traitor,&#8221; said she.
&#8220;I believe he was a good man.&#8221;</p>

<p>They went carefully over each beam, and
crept again into the dusty cupboards.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we&#8217;ll go to the barn,&#8221; said Elizabeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you expect to find there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, but I&#8217;m going.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Elizabeth had left the attic for the last spot
to be visited in the house, so she left the barn
chamber as the most promising quarter of the
barn. It was a large room on the main floor which
had evidently been used at one time as a living-room,
for there was an opening in the wall for a
stovepipe.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>&#8220;I think the hired man usually lived in the
barn chamber,&#8221; said she. &#8220;And I suppose the
harness was kept in these cupboards. This could
easily be put in order for our chauffeur, Herbert!&#8221;</p>

<p>Herbert smiled faintly. He had opened the
door of one of the cupboards and drew out an
old map.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing in here but this, Elizabeth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s unroll it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Herbert grew white. It was a map
of Adams County. From its center Gettysburg
and the surrounding country had been cut, or
rather slashed, as though it were done hastily
with a large knife.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Herbert?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you suppose he showed them with this,
or gave them this piece?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Elizabeth. &#8220;I prefer to think that
some one cut that out to hide or destroy it. They
might not have been able to destroy the whole
map quickly. It signifies nothing whatever.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>Herbert looked at her white face and shook
his head.</p>

<p>After two days of rain the sky cleared. Brother
and sister rested on the doorstep at the end of a
long day. They had not spoken again of the
writing or of the old map. Herbert wondered
whether Elizabeth was now convinced. Elizabeth
sat silently, drinking in the beauty of the evening.
A faint gold showed where the moon would
rise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Elizabeth!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That man is watching us again with his dog
and his gun. I can see him quite plainly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth lifted her voice. All her depression
and anxiety were transmuted into anger against
these disturbers of her peace.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told Colonel Thomas in Gettysburg about
the men who are prowling about,&#8221; said she
loudly and distinctly. &#8220;He said the State police
would be up here the minute I complained. From
what I hear, there are enough crimes in the past<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
to put these men where they won&#8217;t bother us.
They can be punished for these even if they
don&#8217;t do anything now.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a while there was not a sound.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t see him go, but he&#8217;s gone,&#8221; said
Herbert in a whisper. He clasped his hands
tightly. Again he had had his anonymous greeting,
and again by Herculean effort of will had
kept it from Elizabeth. It was not only because
of its ignominious character, it was because at
last he was beginning to see his dependence.
This was, moreover, his own trouble; it was not
Elizabeth&#8217;s, nor a trouble common to them both.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose they&#8217;ve had much chance,&#8221;
said Elizabeth at last; then she added bitterly,
&#8220;When I first saw this man I thought perhaps
we might help the women and children of such
people. But now&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She let her chin sink to her clasped hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you any other plan?&#8221; asked Herbert.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I have. I&#8217;m going to talk to the neighbors.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>&#8220;What neighbors?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going all round this country and wherever
there is an old person, I&#8217;ll find out what he
or she knows about John Baring. There must
be some who remember him, and he must have
had some friends among them. I believe that he
was a good man and that he was kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But would that have any relation to this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it would. Somebody might be able to
give a clue.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What kind of a clue?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, somebody might have lived here, and
have heard him refuse to guide the Confederates.
The Confederates might then have killed him, or
carried him away, or he might have met with an
accident. Somebody might have some testimony
about his previous loyalty.&#8221;</p>
<hr class="chap" />


<p>&#8220;But the book said he had given them information!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The general might have been mistaken in the
confusion. Some one else might have given them
information.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>Herbert shook his head. One could not move
Elizabeth when she believed that she was right.</p>

<p>&#8220;The people might shame you or insult you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They can&#8217;t do either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When are you going to start?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow morning. I&#8217;m going to leave you
to guard the property.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herbert looked at her startled. His short period
of courage had passed. Again he was about
to speak, then he covered his lips with his hand
as if forcibly to restrain himself. The words which
he choked back were, &#8220;Do not leave me alone,
Elizabeth!&#8221; Poor Herbert rose filled with despair.
When Elizabeth called good-night to him,
he did not answer, being certain that he could
not command his voice. He went into his room
and to bed. But he did not sleep.</p>

<p>It was a long time before Elizabeth closed her
eyes. Her mind traveled beyond her visits to the
neighbors.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I have done that, what then?&#8221; said
she. &#8220;If that fails, what can I do?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>It was not merely the rehabilitation of John
Baring which depended upon the success of
Elizabeth&#8217;s plans, it was livelihood itself. She
saw in her first drowsiness rows of young trees
standing in attitudes which were humanly expectant,
awaiting planters who did not come.
She was at once wide awake. Suppose that no one
would work for John Baring&#8217;s grandchildren!</p>

<p>&#8220;I have signed the contract for the trees,&#8221;
said she. &#8220;It would really mean ruin!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter IV<br />

<small>A JOURNEY IN VAIN</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> started out on foot, going northward
along the eastern slope of the mountain.
Here lay large and well-cultivated farms, and
orchards which were already yielding large profits.
Fences were well-made and clear of vines
and briars, lawns were mowed, and in beds and
on porches bloomed an abundance of flowers.
She saw the windows of the Baring house abloom
the winter long with geraniums&mdash;before the
day was over she would ask for slips to plant
for winter blooming.</p>

<p>She found few old persons. It was almost fifty
years since the battle and farms had changed
hands, some of them many times. She saw busy
young men and women and tiny children, but
no grandmothers or grandfathers. When she inquired
she was stared at curiously.</p>

<p>At last in the middle of the morning she saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
on a farmhouse porch an old lady shelling peas.
There was a cat at her feet which was purring a
loud tune and the sound was a welcome to Elizabeth.
She must have a cat&mdash;perhaps she could
take a kitten home with her.</p>

<p>The old lady smiled pleasantly. She had
bright, intelligent eyes and quick, deft hands.
She invited Elizabeth to sit down and they exchanged
views about the beauty of the weather
and the promising condition of the crops.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you lived here always?&#8221; asked Elizabeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was born in this house,&#8221; answered the old
lady. &#8220;When I was married, we stayed here because
my people were old. Now I live here with
my son. I want him to get married, but he can&#8217;t
find the right woman, though he could give her
pretty nearly everything.&#8221; She looked at Elizabeth
meaningly. &#8220;I might send him to get acquainted
with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth smiled at this match-making.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have my own farm on my hands,&#8221; said she.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>&#8220;Where is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth took a deep breath. For a few minutes
she had forgotten the cloud which hung
over her. Then she told her story, Herbert&#8217;s long
illness, the advice of the doctors, their discovery
that their mother still owned her father&#8217;s
property in Pennsylvania, and their journey
East.</p>

<p>&#8220;We settled down here and made a garden,
and then we started out to sell our things. I believe
in being friendly so I told who I was. Immediately
people seemed to be repelled, they
treated me unkindly. Presently I found out that
it was because of my grandfather and something
he was supposed to have done.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old lady looked at her intently. Her hands
had ceased to work and she frowned heavily.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth went over the old formula.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is Elizabeth Scott; my grandfather&#8217;s
name was John Baring.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old lady responded in deeds and not in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
words. She rose and peas and pan fell clattering
to the floor. The cat, startled out of sleep, dashed
away, and all that had seemed a moment ago so
friendly and peaceful was now inimical and confused.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t sit with a granddaughter of John
Baring!&#8221; said the old lady. &#8220;You made a mistake
to come back here! Why, you&#8217;re his image!&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth sat still.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you hear me till the end?&#8221; she asked.
This melodramatic behavior was, she believed,
sincere. She was all the more anxious, unpleasant
as the situation was, to ask questions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what have you to say?&#8221; The old lady
stood with her hand on the latch of the screen
door, ready for instant flight.</p>

<p>&#8220;After I had been treated so rudely, I determined
to find out what was the matter, so I
went to an old gentleman in Gettysburg, Colonel
Thomas, and he told me about John Baring.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He could tell you the truth! He was a soldier
himself. He knows what John Baring did!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>&#8220;Yes, he told me the truth, at least what
seems like the truth. Then I came home. It&#8217;s
very hard to learn suddenly that you are a descendant
of a man whom his neighbors believe
to be a traitor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was a traitor!&#8221; cried the old lady.
&#8220;There never was a worse traitor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When I came home, I went through the
house, carefully, to see whether any papers belonging
to him could have been stowed away
and overlooked. I couldn&#8217;t accept this without
doing something, could I?&#8221;</p>

<p>The old lady&#8217;s hand dropped from the door-latch
and she leaned against the wall, a sign of
relenting in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t find anything that referred directly
to it,&#8221; went on Elizabeth, &#8220;but I did find some
writing on one of the beams in the attic.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What writing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It had nothing to do with the battle, but it
had to do with John Baring. It said, &#8216;I have
built this house the best I know. God bless those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
who go in and out.&#8217; That didn&#8217;t look like the
sentiment of a man who was a traitor, did it? So
I thought I would try to see whether there were
any persons who remembered him and who
could tell me about him. Perhaps there is some
mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t he come back?&#8221; demanded the
old woman. &#8220;That was what finished him. There
were some who couldn&#8217;t believe that he would
do such a thing, but why didn&#8217;t he come back?
He went away with them and having chosen his
company he stayed. Even his friends gave up
then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So he had friends?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course he had friends. Everybody was
his friend! But he was a traitor! He betrayed his
own neighbors! My people lost everything but
the actual ground of the farm. The crops were
ruined, the barn was set afire, everything we
had was taken, stock driven off. And this is a
side road; they would never have known about
it if they hadn&#8217;t been shown.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>To Elizabeth&#8217;s astonishment the old lady was
crying.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I help you gather up the peas?&#8221; she
asked. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid that I&#8217;ve made you feel
badly.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old lady stooped and began to fumble
about.</p>

<p>&#8220;They can be washed,&#8221; said she. Then she
straightened up. &#8220;He wasn&#8217;t an ordinary man.
It was like it says in the Bible, he was a star
fallen from heaven when he did wrong. That
was what we couldn&#8217;t stand, that <i>John Baring</i>
should have done such a thing! Now the heathen
back in the mountain, they would have done
it and nobody would have been surprised. But
<i>John Baring</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth was ready to go.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you know his wife?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She was my companion!&#8221; said the old
woman. &#8220;And I never spoke to her afterwards.
<i>I never spoke to her!</i>&#8221; In the declaration was a
rage as fresh as though its cause were of yesterday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
and&mdash;Elizabeth was certain of it&mdash;a wild
remorse. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t even go to see her buried!&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth wiped her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come again, if you want to,&#8221; said the old
lady.</p>

<p>Then Elizabeth smiled. Grudging as the invitation
was, it gave her the first faint hope that
whatever John Baring had done, his descendants
might in time make their way here in his
old home.</p>

<p>She could see, as she left the yard, one more
farmhouse and this she determined to visit. It
was a mile away and was much smaller and less
well-cared-for than the establishment she was
leaving. There she found an old man, who stood
leaning on the fence and chewing a straw. His
working days were obviously over.</p>

<p>Elizabeth bade him the time of day and asked
him whether he remembered John Baring.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I remember him,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Everybody
remembers him about here. He set Chambersburg
on fire. Three million dollars was lost and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
thousands of people set out on the streets and
animals driv&#8217; off and all kinds of damage done.
It was Baring done it. If he comes back, people
will shoot him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth asked no more questions. He had
become, it seemed, to some, a sort of legendary
demon! But she saw him, reaching up to write
on the attic beam, &#8220;I have built this house the
best I know. God bless those who go in and out.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she walked home, her body was weary, but
her spirits were brighter than they had been. She
imagined that he had gone to the attic on a quiet
Sunday afternoon and had sat looking out over
the rich and beautiful country.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe that he was a traitor!&#8221; said
she.</p>

<p>When she reached home she saw an automobile
at the entrance to the yard. From it Colonel
Thomas waved his hand, and she ran to meet
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, won&#8217;t you come in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I thank you. I was anxious about you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
on account of your neighbors. Have they given
you any trouble?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; they hang round, but they haven&#8217;t
bothered me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, impulsively, Elizabeth told him what
she had been doing. He shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, young lady, you&#8217;ll find it a wild-goose
chase!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They think he burned Chambersburg,&#8221; said
Elizabeth with a faint smile. &#8220;The situation has
a gleam of humor, hasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, the burning took place a year after he
had disappeared!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to ask you some questions about
the battle,&#8221; said Elizabeth. &#8220;When I was a
child, it was my dream to come here.&#8221; Tears
dimmed her eyes. The old gentleman saw them
and looked away.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be up here again one of these days, then
I&#8217;ll bring you some books.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And will you stop and visit with us for a
while?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>&#8220;Yes. You&#8217;ll not take any risk with those
rascals beyond you, will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth promised.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have only one accomplishment and
that is shooting, but I don&#8217;t believe you need be
afraid of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a day Elizabeth stayed at home. Herbert,
who was always quiet, was even quieter than
usual, but she discovered no clue to his depression.
He was under no more of a cloud than she;
he worked no harder; it was time that he lifted
up his head.</p>

<p>When she started out on her next journey of
exploration she knew that she was doing that of
which the old gentleman would not approve.
She went not to the north where lay the cultivated
farms, but turned in toward the south on
the old wood road which led into the mountain
and toward the settlement of the mountaineers.
She had no serious expectation of making any
important discovery; it was rather with an
Elizabethan desire to finish that which she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
begun. Among ignorant people like the mountaineers
there were often old persons whose
memories were long.</p>

<p>For almost an hour she went on without seeing
a sign of human life. The towering trees interlaced
their branches far above her head,
sometimes she could see long distances, sometimes
the view was cut off on both sides by
thickets of rhododendron. She saw many deer;
once a fox crossed her path, and partridges rose
whirring. The road, if it could be called a road,
rose gradually. Presently she had to pick her
way over large clods of ground which had been
dug up from the side and tossed into the middle.
Some one was mending the road according to
the inexplicable method followed in the neighborhood.
A moment later she heard the sound
of voices, and at the next turn she came upon
three men working with mattock and spade.
They worked close together as though to forget
the lonely forest, and they talked loudly and a
little nervously.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>At sight of Elizabeth they stared open-mouthed.
No other sort of appearance could
have surprised them as much as that of a young
woman alone in the wood road.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-morning,&#8221; said Elizabeth.</p>

<p>The men did not answer her good-morning in
kind, but made astonished inquiry.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not alone, miss?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going, miss?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m looking for a house. Aren&#8217;t there any
on this road?&#8221;</p>

<p>The men looked at one another.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s houses of a certain kind. There&#8217;s
one round the bend; that&#8217;s the nearest. But if I
were you I wouldn&#8217;t go any farther. There&#8217;s a
good deal of reckless shooting in these woods,
miss, and the people ain&#8217;t very hospitable except
with bullets.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>You</i> aren&#8217;t afraid!&#8221; said Elizabeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but that&#8217;s different.&#8221; The speaker
scratched his head seeking a reason for the difference.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
&#8220;You see they know we ain&#8217;t spyin&#8217; on
&#8217;em, and ain&#8217;t likely to give any information
against &#8217;em. You see there ain&#8217;t no women goes
in here but a nurse sometimes, and she ain&#8217;t
afraid of nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are there women living in there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you call them women,&#8221; said a second
voice. &#8220;There&#8217;s an old one in the first house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll walk that far,&#8221; said Elizabeth. &#8220;You&#8217;ll
be working right here, will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, miss.&#8221;</p>

<p>She knew that the men did not begin to work
as long as she was in sight. Suddenly one of
them ran after her.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a crazy old woman,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But
she&#8217;s paralyzed and she can&#8217;t hurt you. Don&#8217;t
be afraid if she hollers!&#8221;</p>

<p>She thanked him and he stood still and stared
at her. When he returned to his mates, the
three contemplated one another in silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Could she be a teacher?&#8221; asked one.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>&#8220;They chased the last teacher away before
she ever taught.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we oughtn&#8217;t to make a noise with
our implements, but we ought to move up
closer,&#8221; suggested the third.</p>

<p>The three moved slowly up the road one behind
the other.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was thankful for the warning about
the old woman&#8217;s &#8220;hollering.&#8221; It began suddenly
and so near that she was startled. The cabin was
hidden in a thicket; if it had not been for the
shrill voice, she would have passed it. She parted
the branches and looked into a little open space
at a log house surrounded by heaps of wretched
débris gathered in years of careless, slovenly
living. She slipped in through the opening made
by her arms and went to the door.</p>

<p>The single room held three pieces of furniture,
a queer old charcoal stove, a bed made of saplings
with the bark still on and covered with a
mattress from which the stuffing of leaves was
bursting, and a broken chair. The chair stood by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
the bed and on it was a tin cup filled with some
unrecognizable liquid and a part of a rough loaf
of grayish bread. On the bed lay a pitiful old
body of which only the dull eyes and lips and
one hand seemed still alive.</p>

<p>The eyes peered at Elizabeth as though the
room were dark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is a human being coming to visit me in my
misery?&#8221; asked the old voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Elizabeth, aghast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you the nurse?&#8221; the question was put
with feverish eagerness.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but perhaps I can do something to
make you more comfortable.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old woman began to cry loudly like a
child.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, there ain&#8217;t. He&#8217;s been after me again,
tormentin&#8217; me an&#8217; tauntin&#8217; me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s been after you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My son. He wants the forty dollars what is
all I have in this yearth, to buy him a gun, an&#8217; I
want it to bury me. I want to be buried decent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
with a preacher an&#8217; the singin&#8217; of psalms an&#8217;
prayin&#8217; to carry me away from this yearth. He
can&#8217;t get it now, but he can get it when I&#8217;m
dead.&#8221; She began to scream, &#8220;I want to be buried
decent! I want to be buried decent!&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth went nearer to the dreadful bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you make a will?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Learnin&#8217; is the possession of some, but not of
none in the mountains,&#8221; said the old woman.
She began to cry again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll write a will for you if I can find anything
to write with,&#8221; offered Elizabeth.</p>

<p>The old woman made a desperate effort to
raise herself on her elbow and thus see more
plainly this comforting visitor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will it hold in the courts of men?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will hold if you have the forty dollars,&#8221;
Elizabeth assured her. &#8220;There are some men
back here who will witness it, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fortunately one of the road-makers had a dull
pencil and an old envelope. But they were not so
willing to help as Elizabeth expected. At last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
after a great deal of persuasion the youngest
consented to go with her. She wrote a brief
statement and the old woman put a mark on
it, and the road-maker signed his name as witness.
Then he hurried away, glad to get out of
the filthy cabin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put it up there back of the beam, lady. It&#8217;s
a place my offspring have never found.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t I do anything to make you comfortable?
I could heat some water and&mdash;&#8221; as she
spoke Elizabeth looked round for a vessel or
cloths or soap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Water shortens life,&#8221; said the old soul as
though she were quoting a proverb.</p>

<p>Then Elizabeth asked her a question, because
she had come to ask it, not because she had
either expectation or desire of having it answered
here.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever know John Baring?&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth made at once for the door. From
the old lips fell a stream of denunciation, violent
and profane.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>&#8220;He lost the battle! It was him as did it! He
lost the battle!&#8221; The old woman denounced not
only John Baring, but his descendants to distant
generations.</p>

<p>Elizabeth did not stay to hear the end. She
stepped out into the road and walked rapidly
back. At the bend, seeing the road-makers, she
drew a deep breath of relief. They were still
standing motionless.</p>

<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t expect you&#8217;d stay long, miss.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a dreadful old woman!&#8221; said Elizabeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re all dreadful, miss, but the fear of
God&#8217;s bein&#8217; put into &#8217;em by the constabulary.
They&#8217;ve built too many huckleberry fires&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are huckleberry fires?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When they wanted a good crop, they&#8217;d light
the woods and acres of trees would burn. They&#8217;s
always a good crop of huckleberries after a fire.
But one of &#8217;em, Sheldon, went to the penitentiary
for it, and there ain&#8217;t been any since. Now
they&#8217;s often a constabulary round and they
know it. This was Sheldon&#8217;s mammy what you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
was visitin&#8217;. Sheldon has a strong-willed wife
too. The women they&#8217;s gettin&#8217; new notions.
They go down sometimes an&#8217; look at the Chambersburg
trolley, and they twist up their hair
different. It&#8217;s the women&#8217;s day, miss.&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth thanked them for their protection,
and walked on. After a while she smiled grimly.
On the other side of the mountain they thought
that John Baring had set Chambersburg afire.
Here they thought he had lost the battle. But
the battle hadn&#8217;t been lost. It was a benighted
community, indeed!</p>

<p>Herbert was nervously watching for her when
she reached home.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t do this again!&#8221; said he crossly.</p>

<p>Elizabeth looked at him. If Herbert was going
to be cross in addition to being babyish, then
she would have trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t,&#8221; she promised.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you find out anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; said Elizabeth, protecting him
once more.</p>

<small>AN ALARMING MESSAGE</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> pleasant afternoon in July Colonel Thomas
came again, bringing Elizabeth the books which
he had promised. He made the journey not only
for her sake, but to satisfy his own desire for an
audience. He had begun to believe that the position
of Elizabeth and her brother would not
be intolerable if they had courage to persist. His
car waited at the road&#8217;s edge, and he walked
in to the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;A car doesn&#8217;t seem to belong in here, does
it?&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to have one ourselves some
day,&#8221; declared Elizabeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going to stay, are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t be driven away. I&#8217;ve really had
a peaceful time for three weeks. We sold our
goods anonymously in Chambersburg.&#8221; Elizabeth
smiled wearily. &#8220;Please come and sit down.
You are our first unarmed caller.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>&#8220;They haven&#8217;t bothered you again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps they are really frightened,&#8221; said
Colonel Thomas. &#8220;I came up partly to see you
and partly to have a look at the ruins of the old
furnace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean the ruins near the park?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; that was Thad Stevens&#8217;s furnace and
the Confederates burned it. Great man, Thaddeus
Stevens, young lady, as great as the hatred
felt for him and that&#8217;s saying a good deal. He
had a vision&mdash;the equality of men before their
Creator and nothing else mattered, personal
safety least of all. He lived here in this county
from 1818 till 1842, and this county sent him to
the legislature, as its representative. When he
first came South, he saw in Maryland a slave
girl being sold. He had three hundred dollars in
the world to buy his law library, and instead he
bought the girl and set her free. He was a representative
from this district when he said, &#8216;Hereditary
distinctions of rank are sufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
odious; but that which is founded upon poverty
is infinitely more so.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you&mdash;&#8221; suddenly the old gentleman
thrust out his arms, as though to free his elbows
from restraint. Then he leaned back and began
to rock. His daughter, if she had been present,
would have laid down her book and taken up
her sewing and would have begun a long seam.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you that this is the most interesting
State in the United States and this the most interesting
county in the State. We had squatter
troubles, whites pushing into the country which
had not yet been bought from the Indians, and
thereby endangering the safety of the whole
border, men who refused to move back, pioneers
of the finest water, but law-breakers in fact. It&#8217;s
interesting to think where the world would have
been by this time if laws hadn&#8217;t been broken,
if squatters hadn&#8217;t pushed on and buccaneers
hadn&#8217;t sailed the main.&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth sat on the doorstep, her hands
clasped round her knees. If only Herbert were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
here!&mdash;but Herbert had ridden up into the
woods.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we had interesting Jesuit settlements,
overflow by mistake from Lord Baltimore&#8217;s
land to the south. We had all the ante-war troubles,
slaves escaping over the border and claiming
our protection. We protected &#8217;em too with a
flourishing underground railroad. But the brigands
used to capture them; sometimes they captured
our own free darkies and carried them off.
There was a young black woman with her children
who had lived as a free woman in our
county, who was captured and carried screaming
in the dead of night through the streets of
Gettysburg, she and each of her children across
the saddle of a rascal. A posse was made up, but
they couldn&#8217;t be rescued. In the end they got
back, and one of those children grew up in my
grandfather&#8217;s family. When the Confederates
came she crept under the old valanced bed in
the downstairs bedroom, and my little brother
who crept in there too always remembered two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
details, the spurred feet of the officers which he
could see under the valance and the deathly
green-gray of that young girl&#8217;s face. She must
have been almost twenty, but the terror had
never left her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we had the battle, and you will acknowledge
that that was something!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Elizabeth. &#8220;What happened
about here at the time of the battle?&#8221;</p>

<p>Colonel Thomas stooped and picked up one
of the books which he had laid on the doorstep.</p>

<p>&#8220;The best lengthy account of the battle was
written by a famous Frenchman, the Count of
Paris. Here it is.&#8221; He turned from page to page.</p>

<p>&#8220;This will answer your question. This is after
the first day&#8217;s fight. &#8216;Lee, having determined not
to provoke a decisive battle until the concentration
of his army was accomplished, must naturally
have resorted to every device in order to
complete this concentration before that of his
adversary. This was easy for him to do, for two
of his three army corps were entirely under his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
control at the close of the first day. Longstreet
was still absent. Pickett&#8217;s division had remained
at Chambersburg for the purpose of covering
the defiles of South Mountain; an order to join
the army was forwarded to him, but it could not
reach him until the next day. The other two
divisions, under McLaws and Hood, had started
from Greenwood in the morning, after having
successfully aided in the passage of Johnson&#8217;s
division.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Colonel Thomas stopped and looked at Elizabeth
uneasily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; said Elizabeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;They all followed the same road. Messengers
were sent to expedite their movements; an
extraordinary order which had directed the supply
train to pass before them had caused a great
loss of time which could not be repaired; in fact,
the road, muddy and broken up, was encumbered
by vehicles, loaded with provisions and ammunition,
that were proceeding in the direction of
the battle-field, and by others that were already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
returning with some of the wounded.&#8217; You see
there was dreadful congestion and confusion.&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth looked at him steadily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was that when my grandfather was supposed
to have given them help?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Colonel Thomas. &#8220;They
wanted to find another way to get in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth said nothing. But she thought of
the old map with its center gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t believe it!&#8221; said she stubbornly.</p>

<p>Colonel Thomas acted upon impulse.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been making some investigations,&#8221;
said he, quite as though he had not determined
to say nothing whatever to Elizabeth about
his investigations. &#8220;I looked again at General
Adams&#8217;s letter. His statement about John Baring
is followed by a row of asterisks, signifying
that something was omitted at that place. They
may have forced your grandfather&mdash;that would
be a mitigation. If I find anything, I&#8217;ll straighten
the matter out publicly; I promise you that!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he rose to go.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>&#8220;My brother will be back soon. I wish he
might have seen you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to see him. But I&#8217;m a little late for
an appointment now. I&#8217;ll come another time.
I&#8217;m old-fashioned and I don&#8217;t like to think of
you here all by yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth thanked him once more for the
books, then she walked with him to his car. She
watched it plunge down the mountain-side.
Colonel Thomas was apparently afraid neither
of speed nor of speed laws.</p>

<p>When she returned to her doorstep, she found
another visitor, a tall, middle-aged woman in a
serviceable blue dress with a white collar.</p>

<p>&#8220;I came down through the woods,&#8221; she explained.
&#8220;I&#8217;m the State nurse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth hastened to welcome her. Her
cheeks glowed. Here was the sort of friendliness
of which she had dreamed! Did the nurse know
nothing about them, or didn&#8217;t she care what
their grandfather was said to have done?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been up to see Old Mammy Sheldon,
and she tells me some one made a will for her. I
met the road-menders, and they told me where
you lived. I&#8217;m going to stop some day to talk
about those wretched people, if I may.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may, indeed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Next winter I&#8217;m going to have this side of
the mountain for my bailiwick. I wonder whether
you would take me to board and lodge?&#8221;</p>

<p>The nurse, watching Elizabeth, thought with
a start that she grew pale.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will, indeed!&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth walked with her guest to the road
and watched her out of sight. Then she stood
still. She had been meaning for days to attend to
an important errand. On a cross-road a half-mile
below them lived the farmer who had been recommended
to her to set out the orchard, and it
was quite time that the bargain with him was
made. Now, without returning for her hat, she
walked down the road.</p>

<p>She met the farmer at the entrance to his lane,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
and there stated her errand. She had not got
farther than the first sentence when she saw
that he knew who she was and that her request
was in vain.</p>

<p>&#8220;They tell me that you know all about setting
out orchards.&#8221;</p>

<p>The farmer shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss, I tell you how it was. My father lost
everything in the war, even his own life. Then the
Confederates came here and, thanks to John
Baring, they found out all about us, and they
took everything my mother had, all our money
and stock, and they ruined our fields and gardens.
I know it was part of war and all that. I
forgive the soldiers. But I can&#8217;t forgive John
Baring. I&#8217;m sorry to disappoint you, but I can&#8217;t
work for you. I don&#8217;t believe I could stay in
the neighborhood. Folks wouldn&#8217;t be friendly
with me; that is the way it would work out. I
know you&#8217;re all right, a good, law-abiding citizen,
and I&#8217;m sorry for you. You see, the folks
round here are afraid of the Baring stock, that&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
the sum total of it. I <i>am</i> sorry for you, young lady.
Ain&#8217;t there any other place that you can live?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve talked to people about him,&#8221; said
Elizabeth. &#8220;They all say he was considered to
be a good man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I guess that&#8217;s right.&#8221; The farmer repeated
his question. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t there any other
place you could live, miss? I tell you why I ask.
That place has a bad name. Nobody who ever
rented it had good luck. They died, or they went
crazy, or the men didn&#8217;t keep sober. You must
know that it was empty most of the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why had it a bad name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, of course I don&#8217;t believe those things.
But I&#8217;ve heard tell as how folks <i>saw</i> John Baring
wandering about. He had a long white beard
and he&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he didn&#8217;t have a long white beard!&#8221;
contradicted Elizabeth. &#8220;He wasn&#8217;t an old man,
he wasn&#8217;t even middle-aged! It&#8217;s the mountaineers
who go wandering about. They think the
place is theirs.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>The farmer looked at her and shook his head
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t get their ill-will, miss. They&#8217;re
thieves, and they set things afire, and I expect
they wouldn&#8217;t stop at murder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see why you citizens have allowed
them to remain as they are all these years.&#8221;</p>

<p>The farmer opened his gate.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s better to let some things be,&#8221; he explained.
&#8220;There are some things you&#8217;d better
just stand, like skunks and weasels. They can&#8217;t
be brought to judgment, they&#8217;re too all-fired
sly and disagreeable.&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth climbed the road slowly. She saw
that in another week the golden-rod would be
in bloom. Already, though it was only July, a
bright red branch of a gum tree showed here and
there in the woods.</p>

<p>Then she quickened her steps. She had not
seen Herbert since noon and that was a long
time for him to spend alone in the woods. For
several days he had been more quiet than usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
and she believed that he was growing more depressed.
At first he had gained in strength and
weight, but now he was losing. Herbert was all
she had; it would be madness to carry her plans
for him to the point of risking his life! They
would go to a city; they would do anything in
the world that he wished to do.</p>

<p>Then as she entered the yard the old place put
its spell upon her once more. If this cloud could
be removed, Herbert would be as anxious to stay
as she. It was theirs, and never in the world
could they possess elsewhere anything so beautiful.</p>

<p>To her astonishment Herbert had not come,
though the woodland must be by this time almost
dark.</p>

<p>&#8220;He rode to the upper end and Joe is slow as
molasses,&#8221; said she aloud for the sake of hearing
a human voice. Then she set about preparing
the kind of supper that Herbert liked. For a
while she whistled; then her own whistling disturbed
her. When supper was prepared she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
walked to the edge of the woodland and called,
then she walked back to the house. She remembered
now that she had a new blow to transmit
to him. If their orchards could not be
planted, then they had reason for anxiety. At
least she would not tell him until after supper.
She said aloud her mother&#8217;s proverb about an
empty stomach. She knew as she said it that
she was trying to keep out of her mind another
thought.</p>

<p>But the thought was not to be put off.</p>

<p>&#8220;In a few minutes it will be quite dark!&#8221; said
Elizabeth in terror. She walked again to the border
of the woods, and again back to the house.
She should never have allowed him to go alone.
But he had proposed to look for traces of old
boundary lines and she had consented, glad of
his independence.</p>

<p>As she reached the edge of the woods once
more, she looked back over her shoulder at the
house. She had been in but one room and she
felt suddenly afraid, afraid of the great bulk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
afraid of the dark corners, afraid of the deep cellar
and the cubby-holes in the attic. She turned
and crossed the yard to the barn.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he has come back, Joe is here!&#8221;</p>

<p>But the stable was empty. Elizabeth then
walked directly to the front door and back to the
kitchen and there lit the lamp and lifted it from
the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I find another vague notice?&#8221; said she
to herself. &#8220;Or a positive threat of kidnapping?&#8221;</p>

<p>A notice was exactly what she found. Tossed
in at the window of her own room, lying just
where the first soiled scrap of paper had lain,
was another. Upon it was the same gruesome
sign of skull and cross-bones and below another
ill-written message.</p>


<p class="center">You bring that paper and you can hav him back.</p>

<p>&#8220;What paper?&#8221; said Elizabeth. &#8220;Have him
back! Who! Where is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>But no voice answered, either from the house
or from the dusky woodland.</p>

<hr class="chap" />






<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter VI<br />

<small>ANOTHER VAIN JOURNEY</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> stood still, the lamp shaking in her
hand. When at last she had taken the few steps
between her and her bureau and had set down
the lamp it seemed to her that she had accomplished
a great feat.</p>

<p>They commanded her to bring back &#8220;the
paper.&#8221; What paper? Was it the will she had
written for the poor old woman? Herbert&#8217;s safety
should not be jeopardized for that! It lay on the
beam in her house. What had they done with
Herbert? Had they carried him to some cave or
den, or to some dreadful cabin like the one she
had visited? Would they torture him, starve
him?</p>

<p>Elizabeth quite lost her head. She looked
again into the stable to convince herself that Joe
was really not there. Then she started into the
blackness of the wood road. As she went, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
called, and the echo from the higher hill broken
by the trees answered her faintly, &#8220;Herbert!
Herbert!&#8221; Or was it a voice mocking her distress?</p>

<p>Before she had gone half a mile, she realized
that nothing was to be gained by this procedure.
She was not sure that she was still in the road;
she had walked into trees, and long shoots of
crow&#8217;s-foot, which grew only in the deeper
woods, reached out and grasped her ankles. If
she lost the road, she would have to spend the
night in the woods and that would not profit
Herbert. She must start back while she was still
sure that she could extricate herself.</p>

<p>Once more she seemed to hear voices, and
called. If Herbert were near, he would answer.
But when she stopped and listened, she heard
only the murmuring wind.</p>

<p>Again she grew terror-stricken and started to
run. There was no unhappy situation in Herbert&#8217;s
life from which she had not rescued him,
whether it was from the small ills of childhood or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
the more serious troubles of his later days. She
blamed herself now for having expected too
much of him. He was still frail and she had required
him to take the part of a strong man. For
the past few weeks there had been not a coldness,
but a silence between them. She should have
told him the full extent of the hatred for their
grandfather or she should not have left him alone.</p>

<p>Then she started to run. Now the road was
comparatively smooth and she knew each turn.
He must be at home. This was not the day of
brigands! Surely she would find him watching
for her, worried because she had not come!</p>

<p>But Herbert was not at home. The old house
was grim and silent and empty.</p>

<p>Common sense directed that she should go at
once for help. But who would help her on this
inhospitable hill? Would people not rather rejoice
in her misfortune? Who would venture
now, at night, into the neighborhood of the
mountaineers of whom every one was afraid by
day? She thought of the words of the farmer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
&#8220;There are things you&#8217;d better just let be, like
weasels and skunks.&#8221;</p>

<p>She remembered all that Colonel Thomas had
told her of them, of their certain aim, of their indifference
to authority. It would be far better to
negotiate with them herself, to go alone and
make any concession to bring Herbert back.
Then she and Herbert would flee from the home
of their ancestors never, never to return.</p>

<p>It was now almost midnight and the distance
to dawn was not long. Elizabeth sat all night
at the window, listening, and certain that she
heard occasionally the sound of a footstep. At
the first sign of daylight she would start and go
on foot to the old cabin and thence into the
mountaineers&#8217; settlement.</p>

<p>Just before daylight she heard a sound and
saw a dark form emerge from the woods. She
leaned far out the window to see as well as she
could. At first she thought it was Herbert, but it
proved to be too large an object to be human.
When she recognized old Joe, she rushed out and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
took him by the bridle. He was dull of vision
and feeble of step and therefore ill-equipped to
make his way alone through thickets and over
rocks, but eventually instinct had brought him
home, though he had suffered cruelly on the
journey. His skin was torn by briars, his knees
were bleeding from numerous falls.</p>

<p>Elizabeth caught the bridle. In the dim light
she could see that it had been severed apparently
by a knife. She talked to him as she fed
him and brushed him gently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you poor Joe, you&#8217;ve got to start out
again! I&#8217;m sorry for you, but I&#8217;ve got to go as
fast as I can!&#8221;</p>

<p>In the first gray light she climbed on old Joe&#8217;s
back. He gave a resentful whinny and then
started into the woods in which he had recently
had such perilous adventure. Once he snorted as
though in alarm, and Elizabeth looked round
sharply. But she could see no dangerous object,
and Joe could not speak to tell her of a guard
asleep under a tree.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>Little by little the woods grew gray; then the
trunks of the trees turned pale gold. The chorus
of the birds sounded from the tree-tops and from
every thicket. It was the moment in which the
cheerful heart is most uplifted.</p>

<p>But Elizabeth grew more anxious. She really
expected that she would see Herbert, making his
way homeward, but she heard no human sound,
saw no human being until she came in sight of
the little cabin. The road-makers were not at
work, and the last bend of the road seemed like a
door which would close behind her. No living
soul would know where she was or where Herbert
was, except their enemies. She had left no clue
in the house, for she had carried with her in her
pocket even the notice which she had found upon
the floor.</p>

<p>When she came in sight of the cabin she heard
Mammy Sheldon crying. Did the poor soul cry
all the time, or did her ear warn her of the
approach of a step, and did she then begin
to sob and moan? She recognized Elizabeth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
and made a frantic effort to lift herself on her
elbow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t give it to him! Don&#8217;t give it to him!&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth went close to the bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it he wants?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He wants my last testament, so as to tear it
up or burn it an&#8217; to have the money to spend for
a gun. My money to be buried decent with a
preacher an&#8217; the singin&#8217; of psalms. Don&#8217;t give it
to him! Don&#8217;t give it to him!&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth could see on the beam above her
head the edge of the white paper, still undisturbed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is my brother?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mammy Sheldon looked long at Elizabeth.
Into her eyes came a look of crazy cunning.</p>

<p>&#8220;They shot him,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Of course they
shot him! It was right outside this door.&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth laughed hysterically.</p>

<p>&#8220;What nonsense! They did not shoot him!
Where is he? I helped you; now you help me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old woman laid her head down on her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
poor pillow. She began to cry once more about a
decent burial. Whether she was trying to deceive,
or whether her mind could not hold an
idea more than a moment, it was hard to say.</p>

<p>Elizabeth walked to the door and looked out.
The tall trees, the glimpses of sky, the brown
earth covered with a carpet of pine needles and
dead leaves&mdash;this was surely no place of execution!
Only the loneliness and the dreadful sound
were ominous; there was no bird&#8217;s song, even in
the early morning, loud enough to make itself
heard above the wild sobbing.</p>

<p>Elizabeth went back to the bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is my brother?&#8221; she demanded.
&#8220;They must have come to the house yesterday
and compelled him to come with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old woman did not answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;They want a paper. Is it the paper that I
wrote for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The mention of the &#8220;testament&#8221; caught
Mammy Sheldon&#8217;s attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t give it to them! They&#8217;ll take my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
money and bury me like a dog. Don&#8217;t give it to
them; oh, please, oh, please!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t if you tell me what they have done
with my brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t tell me what they do. I&#8217;m away
off yere from &#8217;em. But they&#8217;ll get their pay!
Their children&#8217;ll treat &#8217;em as they&#8217;ve treated
me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are the people that feed you and take
care of you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Buried,&#8221; answered Mammy Sheldon. &#8220;Dead
and buried.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are not dead and buried! Some one
brought you food within the last few days.&#8221;</p>

<p>But no further answer was to be had from the
old woman. She seemed now to be asleep.</p>

<p>Elizabeth stood for a moment considering.
Then she reached up and pushed the will a little
farther back on the beam. There it could not be
seen, but she could direct them where to find it.
She would pay the old woman&#8217;s funeral expenses
if they destroyed the will and if she died penniless.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
Forty dollars was nothing compared to the
precious life which might now be in danger.</p>

<p>Clambering to old Joe&#8217;s back, Elizabeth
started to go farther into the woods. For herself
she had not the least fear. If she could only see
Sheldon and find what they wanted of her!
Sometimes she bravely determined to hold out
against them even if it were only the will which
they wanted. The old woman should do with her
money what she chose, they should not coerce
her! They would get tired and let Herbert go;
they would not risk their lives for the sake of
forty dollars! If she gave them the will, she
would only be doing what all the other inhabitants
had been doing for generations, ignoring
their crimes for fear of reprisal and giving them
a free hand. It was no wonder they had no fear
of God or man!</p>

<p>But they had actually carried off her brother!
It was difficult to hold to any principle when one
remembered that!</p>

<p>As she rode on, looking eagerly from side to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
side, another suspicion entered her mind. Was it
possible that they suspected Old Mammy Sheldon
of having revealed some secret of the past,
some hidden crime? The farmer had said that
they would not stop at murder. The old woman
had talked about some one who was shot and
buried. Elizabeth shuddered.</p>

<p>Presently she came to a place where the dim
road divided, one fork going toward the right,
the other bending toward the left. There was
nothing which indicated the way to the mountaineers&#8217;
settlement, except that the right-hand
road seemed to run against an almost perpendicular
section of the mountain-side. The lay of the
land seemed to indicate that that road did not
go far.</p>

<p>Selecting the road to the left, she rode on, not
noticing at first the gradual descent. Nor did she
hear back of her the sound of hurried footsteps.
The man at whose sleeping presence Joe had
snorted, paused, panting, at the fork of the road
where she had paused. He looked up and down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
the road into the forest, and even, in a foolish
way, up into the air. Then he ran on to the
right.</p>

<p>Presently Elizabeth began to be doubtful
about her choice, but she decided to ride a little
farther. When at last she was about to turn back,
she found that she had been riding for a few rods
in a little glade and that the road had vanished,
either having ended, or having turned imperceptibly
in another direction. She gave Joe a free
rein, but Joe seemed to have no wisdom about
wood roads.</p>

<p>Now she shed a few tears. She was afraid to
go upward for fear that she would be more hopelessly
lost. If she went directly downward, using
the slope of the mountain for her guide, she
would be going each moment farther away from
Herbert. But that seemed to be the only possible
course to follow. Dismounting, she led old
Joe, who slipped and slid and frequently whinnied
his distress. She would find her way home,
and then there should be no further delay in calling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
Colonel Thomas&#8217;s constabulary to her aid.
It was criminal to have delayed so long.</p>

<p>Once, when she stopped to let Joe rest, she was
confident that she heard, dim and far away, the
sound of a gunshot. There was no following shot
and she was not sure that she was not mistaken,
but the possibilities suggested by the sound horrified
her. She rose and took the unwilling Joe by
the bridle and went on over stones and rocks.
She saw masses of arbutus plants and beautiful
carpets of pine leaves with a pattern of trailing
crow&#8217;s-foot; she passed through stretches of cathedral
woods. She saw strange flowers which
looked like orchids and high, deep thickets of
rhododendron, set with pale blossoms. A month
ago she would have exclaimed with delight; now
she scarcely observed them, or said to herself
while she looked, &#8220;We are going away.&#8221; Late
in the afternoon she saw suddenly a stone fence
and a weed-grown field and recognized her own
property. Then the old house showed through
the trees and she pulled Joe rapidly forward.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>&#8220;Herbert!&#8221; she called, &#8220;Herbert! Herbert!&#8221;</p>

<p>But no Herbert answered.</p>

<p>After stabling old Joe, she hurried to the
kitchen. She would get a bite to eat, then she
would smooth her hair and change her dress and
go directly to the road, there to beg a ride from
the first passer-by. Old Joe could not have carried
her for a square. Her spirits rose. If there
was something one could do the situation was
more tolerable.</p>

<p>When she opened the door of her room, she
saw that a new scrap of paper lay on the floor.
With trembling hand she took it up:</p>

<p class="center">Him in exchang for the paper. It will be wuss
for you if you git any one.</p>

<p>She sat down heavily on the edge of her bed.
The thought of the constabulary riding to her
aid had all the afternoon sustained her. Then she
lifted her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>will</i> go,&#8221; said she. &#8220;They won&#8217;t shoot me,
that is certain.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at herself in the mirror. Her hair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
was untidy and sifted over it were twigs and dust
and the pollen of flowers; her face was soiled and
scratched, her eyes looked wild. She made as
rapid a toilet as she could, and then she started
out. It was already almost dark, so long had been
her dreary journey. She started to run.</p>

<p>Then she stopped. She might have been uncertain
in the afternoon whether or not she had
heard the sound of a gunshot, but now there was
no mistaking. It seemed to her that the bullet
passed immediately before her, that she heard its
whistle. It said to her as distinctly as if a voice
had spoken, &#8220;Stay where you are!&#8221;</p>

<p>She went back to the house. Only a fool would
have gone on after that sort of warning. But
she did not go indoors. She stood on the step and
called.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come here and talk to me. I&#8217;ll listen to what
you have to say! Don&#8217;t hide like a coward!&#8221;</p>

<p>But there was no answer. Perhaps when it was
still darker they would come. She sat down in her
corner of the step and leaned her head against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
the wall. She would be here if they came, she
would&mdash;she would&mdash;her head nodded and she
was asleep.</p>

<p>When she woke it was in answer to an abrupt
summons. She heard simultaneously another
shot and a little sharp crack and some object fell
from above upon her head. She thought it was a
fluttering bird and put up her hand. But the texture
of the object was that of cloth. It was the
flag which had been shot at! Elizabeth stood
with it in her hands. Colonel Thomas had said
that the mountaineers had been in sympathy
with the enemies of their country. Was this
generation traitorous also? Every fiber of her
being stiffened with resentment. Yet, alas! John
Baring&mdash;</p>

<p>Again she stood on the step and called angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come and tell me what you want! Don&#8217;t hide
like a coward!&#8221;</p>

<p>But whether the watcher was deaf, or whether
he was merely a sentinel without power to act or
to answer, he made no response.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>She carried the flag into the house and lighting
the lamp, examined it. In it were half a
dozen bullet-holes. Then she ate a hastily prepared
breakfast and set out into the woods. Once
more daybreak was at hand, and this time she
would not miss the road to the settlement.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>&#8220;MAMMY&#8217;S BOY&#8221;</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Herbert Scott</span> was not a coward&mdash;indeed, his
errand, deep in the woods above the Baring
house on the afternoon when Colonel Thomas
came to see Elizabeth, proved him courageous.</p>

<p>His anonymous and unpleasant communications
had not been threats or warnings, but
taunts. The mountaineers seemed to have come
to the conclusion that he was worth nothing,
that he was a mere appendage attached to the
proverbial apron-string of his sister.</p>

<p>The taunts were never uttered when Elizabeth
was within hearing. Herbert, bending over a
garden-bed, heard from the woodland a shrill
&#8220;Mammy&#8217;s boy! Mammy&#8217;s boy!&#8221; then a laugh.
At first he had walked directly toward the sound,
but he never could see who had uttered it. He
knew, sometimes, that the speaker receded before
him; there was a rustle in the leaves and underbrush,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
and sometimes the call was repeated at
increasing distances. But more often, he could
neither see nor hear a living soul.</p>

<p>But now, on the afternoon when he had
gone to look up the boundary lines, the taunts
changed to a more serious approach. Suddenly
he found himself looking into a gun-barrel. He
recognized at once the holder of the gun and
stood still. He did not throw up his hands or
make any sign of surrender, but he felt the blood
recede from his heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want that paper,&#8221; answered Sheldon, sullenly
and with determination. There was also
another quality in the thick tones&mdash;could it be
fright?</p>

<p>Herbert was wholly mystified.</p>

<p>&#8220;What paper?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The paper the girl got from Old Mammy.
Mammy&#8217;s holdin&#8217; it up to tease me! Mammy&#8217;s
crazy; what she says won&#8217;t go, but we want the
paper.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything about a paper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You lie!&#8221; cried Sheldon.</p>

<p>A little of the blood returned to Herbert&#8217;s
heart. He squared his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not lie!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got it hidden somewhere to make
trouble. Fork it out! We won&#8217;t make no trouble
for them that makes no trouble for us. She got
the road-maker to help her; one of them writ his
name on it. Mammy brags about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herbert was completely bewildered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know nothing about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, you come with me an&#8217; perhaps
you&#8217;ll learn something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My horse is tied over there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about your horse. Come on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herbert obeyed. There was no question as to
the seriousness of Sheldon&#8217;s intentions and there
was no question about the deadly power of his
loaded gun. He led the way slowly and cautiously
down through the woods toward the house. Did
he mean to corral Elizabeth also? Even in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
terror and despair Herbert hoped that Elizabeth
was not at home. Surely she could have no paper
which belonged to these desperadoes!</p>

<p>Before they reached the edge of the woods
where they could look out on the old house, two
men met them. One was a shorter man than Sheldon
with glowering eyes and a black beard which
made him look like a pirate. Elizabeth would have
recognized him as the &#8220;Black Smith&#8221; whom Colonel
Thomas had described. The other was &#8220;Bud.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s went off,&#8221; Black Smith announced.
&#8220;She&#8217;s far down the road.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; ordered Sheldon. &#8220;We&#8217;ll find
that paper.&#8221;</p>

<p>He marched Herbert into the kitchen and
made him open the doors of the cupboard. Then
they went through the house, from cellar to
attic. Confident that he would find nothing,
Herbert searched thoroughly. Under Elizabeth&#8217;s
bureau cover, he found the two warning papers.
His eyes blazed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never saw these. I should think you&#8217;d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
be ashamed of yourselves, big men trying to
frighten a girl!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And a little mammy&#8217;s boy!&#8221; said Sheldon in
an ugly tone.</p>

<p>Then Sheldon took from his pocket a stump
of a lead pencil and another piece of paper and
wrote another bulletin.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll know what to do when she finds that,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;Now march!&#8221;</p>

<p>Herbert went out the front door and round
the house into the woods as he was directed. At
the wood&#8217;s edge, Black Smith fell in with them;
the other remained behind.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do with my sister?&#8221;
demanded Herbert.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know and I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; answered
Sheldon. &#8220;I want the paper, I don&#8217;t want your
sister. Wishin&#8217; she&#8217;d come an&#8217; take care of you,
are you, mammy&#8217;s boy?&#8221;</p>

<p>Herbert made no answer. Now Black Smith
took a share in the conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;The mountain people don&#8217;t stand for no nonsense,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
said he. &#8220;They ain&#8217;t like the people of
the plain. The people of the plain says one thing
and means another, while the mountain people
says one thing and sticks to it. The mountain
people&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut up!&#8221; commanded Sheldon, whether in
weariness of Black Smith&#8217;s loquacity or because
he thought silence best, it was hard to say. There
was a surprising sentimentality about Black
Smith.</p>

<p>&#8220;You talk too much,&#8221; said Sheldon.</p>

<p>The three looked back. From their position
they could see past the corner of the house to a
spot of color still vivid in the afternoon light.
Sheldon lifted his gun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t do that!&#8221; cried Herbert.</p>

<p>But Sheldon only laughed. A bullet struck the
spot of bright color and the flag fluttered a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hit it!&#8221; said Sheldon with satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;You rascal!&#8221; cried Herbert.</p>

<p>Sheldon laughed again as though pleased with
himself.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>&#8220;I shot at that rag many times,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Off
with you! March!&#8221;</p>

<p>When they had penetrated into the deep
woods, Herbert remembered poor Joe.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you that my horse is tied up there,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;He can&#8217;t even crop the grass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll settle him,&#8221; said Sheldon. To Herbert
his tone was vicious. Would they shoot the poor
beast or torture him?</p>

<p>But Sheldon had no such cruel intention, although
he lifted his gun at sight of the old animal,
now restless and whinnying.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t!&#8221; cried Herbert.</p>

<p>The bullet did not touch the horse, but only
the strap which held him. Joe lifted head and
heels. The quick motion tore the pierced bridle
through and Joe was gone, bounding over the
rocks and through thickets as though on a
smooth race-course.</p>

<p>Once or twice Herbert was given directions to
walk toward the right or the left. Otherwise
his captors did not speak. Black Smith had evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
accepted reproof, for he said no more
about the &#8220;mountain people.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herbert began presently to stumble over
stones and projecting roots. It was now almost
dark and his head was dizzy. They seemed after
a while to have stepped into a rough road, even a
road upon which some work had recently been
done. If so, he was not being entirely separated
from the rest of mankind. Then a thought startled
him. Sheldon had spoken of road-makers in
connection with this mysterious paper. There
evidently had been road-makers in the neighborhood.
But Elizabeth could not have come as far
as this!</p>

<p>At last, when it seemed to Herbert that he had
walked almost all night, he began to hear voices,
and in a moment saw a faint light. The light was
darkened, apparently, by the passing of an object
before it. Another man joined them, and
still another.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down!&#8221; ordered Sheldon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; asked Herbert.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>Sheldon took him by the arm and guided him
to what appeared to be the doorway of a cabin.
He sat down, breathing uncomfortably a heavy
human and canine odor which seemed to emanate
from within the cabin. Sheldon whistled
and Herbert felt a panting creature pass him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Watch him!&#8221; ordered Sheldon.</p>

<p>Herbert heard the sound of retreating steps,
of other growls, of voices near at hand. One was
a woman&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll bring destruction on yourselves!&#8221; she
cried. &#8220;You&#8217;re plottin&#8217; an&#8217; plannin&#8217; your own
ruin an&#8217; downfall! The State police won&#8217;t stand
the carrying off of men, they&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The speech ended abruptly, almost as though
a period had been put to it by force.</p>

<p>Herbert heard Sheldon&#8217;s sharp &#8220;Shut up,
Jinny!&#8221; and another whine from Black Smith
about the &#8220;mountain people.&#8221; Then he sat motionless,
hearing the heavy breathing of the
watch-dog, though he could not see him. When
he stretched out his tired legs, the dog growled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
menacingly. He had seen either this dog or one
like him with Sheldon, a tall, gaunt animal with
a bristling collar of fur, and he had no intention
of risking an attack.</p>

<p>His eyes strained in vain to pierce the darkness,
but he could see nothing, not even the
light. He surmised that there were tall trees near
by; he could hear the leaves stirring gently far
above his head. Even the voices had ceased to
sound. Had his captors gone to bed, or had they
shut themselves in somewhere to discuss his
fate?</p>

<p>Sometimes waves of weakness rushed over
poor Herbert, but they were not waves of fright.
Elizabeth would long ago have found the paper
and would have gone for help. He believed that
by morning he might expect her. The summary
treatment which he had received had wrought a
change in him. The high-handedness of his capture
enraged him. He lifted his head and said the
words that Elizabeth had said weeks before,
&#8220;They shall not drive us away!&#8221; He had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
affection for the house of John Baring, and he
shared but few of Elizabeth&#8217;s fond dreams of
clearing his grandfather&#8217;s name of its stain, but
he would not be coerced in this fashion. He despised
the neighborhood which had for so long
tolerated these desperadoes.</p>

<p>He was mistaken about the flight of time.
Twilight had seemed to come early because the
woods were thick and because it was cloudy,
and the journey had seemed hours long because
of his weariness. It was not yet eleven o&#8217;clock
when Sheldon and Black Smith returned with
the two other men. Did these, together with the
man left at the house, represent the total able-bodied
forces?</p>

<p>They carried with them old lanterns, made of
tin and pierced with holes, and they sat down in
a semi-circle before the door of the cabin or dog-kennel
whichever it might be. Sheldon, who
seemed to lead them in everything, spoke first.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, boy, we want that paper, an&#8217; we believe
there is one way to get it. You write an&#8217;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
tell your sis to send it up here. Then you can go,
prompt.&#8221;</p>

<p>Black Smith was, it seemed, like many orators,
not to be permanently suppressed.</p>

<p>&#8220;People have got to be learned that there&#8217;s no
foolin&#8217; with the mountain people,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything about any paper,&#8221;
insisted Herbert. &#8220;My sister didn&#8217;t tell me anything
about a paper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to know anything about the
paper,&#8221; said Sheldon. &#8220;We tell you that the girl
got a sworn paper from Mammy an&#8217; Mammy&#8217;s
out of her head an&#8217; she talks too much. She don&#8217;t
know what she&#8217;s sayin&#8217;, but a sworn lie holds for
the truth.&#8221; He leaned forward and laid a scrap
of paper on Herbert&#8217;s knee. &#8220;You tell her that
you&#8217;re here an&#8217; that you&#8217;re safe, an&#8217; that she
shall send the paper, then by morning you can
go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t make her send it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sheldon laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll send it to get her baby boy!&#8221; said he.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>The insulting words brought Herbert to his
feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;She won&#8217;t do anything of the kind. She&#8217;s
gone for help, long ago, I can tell you that. Do
you think she&#8217;ll sit down there and do nothing?
You don&#8217;t know her! We were told that the instant
you gave us any trouble we could have the
constabulary come up here. They&#8217;ll wipe you
out! They&#8217;ve got your deeds recorded! They&#8217;ll
punish you for the present and the past.&#8221;</p>

<p>A dark figure appeared in the faint speckled
circle of lamplight.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you so!&#8221; said the woman&#8217;s voice,
which Herbert had heard before. &#8220;Destruction
is waiting for us! Destruction from our airless
lives, according to the nurse, and destruction
from the guns of the soldiers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sheldon rose muttering.</p>

<p>&#8220;Git out of here, Jinny!&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman moved backward.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s exactly right,&#8221; said Herbert. &#8220;One of
you has sense, anyhow!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>But Jinny&#8217;s tirade was not taken seriously by
her kinsfolk. Sheldon returned and sat down
heavily.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t suppose, boy, that we left her free
to run round over the country, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Herbert shivered. Was a gun-barrel pointed
also at Elizabeth? Nevertheless, he did not believe
that she would follow the dictation of any
gun-barrel. He saw the desperation of these outlaws
on one side and Elizabeth&#8217;s indifference to
danger and her anger at injustice on the other.
There was also another element. Elizabeth would
be wild with fear for him. At that thought Herbert&#8217;s
cheeks reddened in the darkness. She
would not expect him to be able to help himself!</p>

<p>&#8220;Write what we tell you,&#8221; said Sheldon, tapping
him on the knee.</p>

<p>Herbert glanced down at the paper. The dark
night, which seemed actually to press down upon
him, the encircling men, the den behind him,
the ferocious dogs lurking in the shadow&mdash;he
was acutely conscious of all. He had always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
been taken care of by Elizabeth, and now he saw
the words formed by his hand, &#8220;For my sake,
Elizabeth, send them whatever paper you have!&#8221;</p>

<p>But what paper was it? Why had she not told
him about it? She had no business to keep him
in ignorance! What motive could she have had?</p>

<p>Then Herbert answered his own question.
Elizabeth&#8217;s motive was never a selfish one; she
wished always to spare and defend him. Perhaps
she had thought that she had found a clue,
and losing it, had not wished to disappoint him.
Perhaps she had come upon some fact which had
ended all her hopes. She had seemed quieter of
late. Perhaps, on the other hand, she had really
found a clue, and by appealing to her to save
him, he would spoil everything.</p>

<p>He looked up. He believed again that, even in
the dim light, he saw fear in the scowling faces.
What dreadful secrets this distant corner of the
mountain might hide! What crimes might have
been committed here, undiscovered, perhaps unsuspected!
An old woman might well, in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
dotage, cry out facts at which her family would
be terrified! The blood now rushed through Herbert&#8217;s
veins.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve told her what you want,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;She&#8217;ll have to decide for herself. I won&#8217;t write
anything&mdash;not a word!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was an angry murmur. Black Smith began
to declaim.</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t think the mountain people&#8217;ll
stand for such talk,&#8221; said he wildly. &#8220;You&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut up!&#8221; commanded Sheldon.</p>

<p>Then Sheldon himself uttered a sentence of
more weighty import. He accompanied it with
a sharp stroke of his fist on Herbert&#8217;s knee.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can bury you in the grave with your
gran&#8217;pappy, if that&#8217;s what you want,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;He was a betrayer.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that there came a cry from outside the
circle. Again Jinny had come close to the group
in front of the cabin door.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll see destruction soon enough!&#8221; she
warned.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>Sheldon got to his feet and whistled. Two
great dogs bounded toward him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Watch him!&#8221; he commanded.</p>

<p>At once he and his mates went off into the
darkness.</p>

<small>BLACK SMITH&#8217;S BARGAIN</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> spite of the exertion of all her power of
will, which was not small, Elizabeth found her
step lagging as she went through the woods.
The strenuous efforts of the last days and her abbreviated
hours of sleep had naturally exhausted
her. She had to sit down often to rest. As she did
so, she looked first to this side, now to that. She
was certain that she was watched each moment.
Once she called, &#8220;I know you are there! Don&#8217;t
hide like a coward, but come out!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no answer, though Black Smith, appointed
over her for the night, and now following
her, heard her plainly. Black Smith had not slept
at his post as had her guardian of the night
before.</p>

<p>When she approached the old woman&#8217;s cabin
she could hear no sound. She would go in and get
the will and carry it with her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>But she did not enter the cabin. On the step
lay one of the cross dogs of the mountaineers,
who, when she spoke to him, rose and growled
fiercely. She backed out of the thicket.</p>

<p>At the forks she took the right-hand road. She
had gone only a short distance when she heard
behind her the sound of footsteps, and turned
and looked toward the bend round which she had
come. Black Smith had decided to accompany
her instead of stalking her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; he called.</p>

<p>Elizabeth stood still, recognizing him at once
from the description of Colonel Thomas.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Black Smith grinned at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t no use to come here unless you got
the paper.&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth backed against the tree, appalled
by the savage aspect of Smith.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no paper that would be of any value
to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Black Smith came closer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>&#8220;You made out a paper,&#8221; he insisted. &#8220;We
heard tell of it. You can&#8217;t keep things secret
from the mountain people. You&#8217;ve got to get it
for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was a will made for the sick old
woman,&#8221; explained Elizabeth. &#8220;She was afraid
that her son would take her money for a gun and
she would not have decent burial. I made a will
for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was other things on it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was nothing else on it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She says there was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then she doesn&#8217;t tell the truth!&#8221;</p>

<p>Black Smith came still closer. The odor of
liquor was strong on his breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, git the paper! No paper should
be written by strangers in the settlement of the
mountain people. There&#8217;s those of us can write.
If papers is to be writ we can write them. An&#8217; we
can read what is on papers that has been writ.
You fetch this paper an&#8217; we&#8217;ll tell what&#8217;s on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth hesitated. The old woman could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
hardly be made more miserable than she was.
She would go and get the paper now and Herbert
should be free.</p>

<p>Black Smith was impatient with her delay.
He looked at her menacingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here. Your brother ain&#8217;t gettin&#8217; much
to eat while you&#8217;re foolin&#8217;! He sets all the time
an&#8217; cries for his mammy, that&#8217;s what he does!
We know his kind, an&#8217; we have no use for such
folks among the mountain people. We know
what else was on that paper beside a will, an&#8217;
you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve told you all that was on it!&#8221; Elizabeth&#8217;s
answer was almost a scream. &#8220;You and your
mountain people are wicked!&#8221;</p>

<p>The man scowled still more heavily. It seemed
to Elizabeth that the time for delay was past.
She was about to say, &#8220;Come on, I&#8217;ll find it for
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Smith&#8217;s words halted her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your brother can find place in the grave with
his gran&#8217;pappy, that he can. The mountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
people didn&#8217;t take nothin&#8217; from him, I can tell
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth&#8217;s hands pressed close upon the
coarse bark of the tree against which she leaned.
The pressure hurt, but she wished it to hurt. It
seemed to her that physical pain would help
her to clearness of thought. Once she feared that
she was going to faint, then strength came back.
Was she to hear even from these evil lips mockery
and reproach for John Baring? Had these
been his friends? Had he, perhaps, hidden here
among them, had he taken refuge with them?
They, too, were enemies of their country&mdash;one
of them had fired upon the flag! Did John
Baring die here, was he, perhaps, killed by them
after some quarrel? Was it he who, in the old
woman&#8217;s words, had been &#8220;shot and buried&#8221;?
Was there any truth in anything they said?</p>

<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t a hundred yards away where he
lays,&#8221; said Black Smith. &#8220;He went counter to
the mountain people, an&#8217; see what become of
him! Will you give me the paper?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>Elizabeth bent her head. John Baring had
ruined the lives of many of his kin; he should
not destroy Herbert&#8217;s. Again she determined
that she would give them the paper and provide
so that the old woman should have the decent
burial that she craved, and then they would obey
the advice of friend and foe and go away.</p>

<p>That is, they would go, if it were not too late.
She did not believe that they would starve
Herbert, or that he sat crying for her. But he
might be ill.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will&mdash;&#8221; began Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, Elizabeth stopped. The arching
trees seemed to contract into the ceiling of
a low room, she smelled not the fresh, living,
woodsy odors about her, but the odor of dry
wood, of old beams and broad ceiling-boards,
dried for fifty years under a roof. She saw herself
rising on tiptoe to read, and she heard Herbert&#8217;s
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have built this house the best I know. God
bless those that go in and out.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>For a moment Elizabeth saw more than the
writing, she seemed to look into a pair of sad
and steady eyes. Once more in a rush of confused
emotions a wave of semi-unconsciousness
passed over her and she found herself pressing
her hands again hard against the rough bark
of the old tree. Her eyes, staring at Black Smith,
looked wild. She saw a scene of which she often
dreamed, the old house surrounded by armed and
mounted men. She heard the creak of wagons,
the steady, rhythmic beat of marching troops,
the cries of the wounded, already being carried
to the rear, the throng and press which
filled the steep and narrow road. She saw the
clear blue moonlight over the wide plain, and the
flaring torchlight at hand; she seemed to see
John Baring standing in his doorway, looking
at it all, hearing a question, a demand which
could not be put off. It may have been that his
wife stood beside him with her baby in her arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have built this house the best I know.&#8221; He
had intended to live here long years, to die here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
decades from now&mdash;perhaps that intention
went through his mind.</p>

<p>But he had not been given a long time for
dreaming. He must decide at once. There was
probably a heavy hand on his shoulder, a harsh
voice at his ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is a horse for you! We must know another
way to Gettysburg and that quickly!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Elizabeth awoke. This was not the time
for dreaming, for trying to reconstruct the mental
processes of John Baring!</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot think,&#8221; she said to herself. &#8220;There
is something in the back of my mind, but I cannot
get at it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you one more minute, missy, to
decide what you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Black Smith drew from his pocket a giant
silver watch and looked at it.</p>

<p>Elizabeth looked down at the ground, then
steadily up at Black Smith. There was in her
blue eyes a hard expression. Thus had she looked
when she had refused to sell her vegetables to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
rude woman in Chambersburg. Thus had she
looked also when she had first heard of John
Baring&#8217;s crime. From some ancestor she had inherited
a stubborn will. Her affection, her common
sense, her pride, directed that she free
Herbert promptly and that they go away as
soon and as quietly as they could. But to neither
affection nor common sense nor pride would she
yield. She would have made a thorough-going
early Christian martyr.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do I know that after I have given
you the paper you will let him go?&#8221; she asked.
&#8220;I might get the paper and you might not be
satisfied with it and refuse to bring him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Black Smith looked at her warily. He rather
admired this finesse and he had no fear that she
would go away.</p>

<p>&#8220;The mountain people keep their word,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;You set on that rock an&#8217; I&#8217;ll bring him an&#8217;
others.&#8221; Suddenly he grinned. &#8220;If you ain&#8217;t here,
of course you know what happens to your baby
boy. An&#8217; don&#8217;t you come after me!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t come after you,&#8221; promised Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Once Black Smith stopped and looked back
at her. Then he went on. Elizabeth could not see
that he followed any road.</p>

<p>When he was out of sight she hid her face for
a moment in her hands; then she looked up.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be a little while until they come back,&#8221;
said she to herself. &#8220;Then they will try to catch
me. They will think I have gone down to the
house and they will hunt and by that time&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose and looked down the side of the
mountain.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had old Joe to lead the other day,&#8221; said she.
&#8220;And I had some respect for my bones and my
clothes and I went round obstacles instead of
going over them. Now&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked back over her shoulder. The woods
had closed absolutely behind Black Smith.
She believed that the settlement of the mountain
people must be some distance away, else
sounds would have penetrated to her ears. It
was a desperate chance, but she took it. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
started recklessly, not back to the comparatively
open ground, but in a direct line downward.
She fell and she picked herself up; she caught her
dress in briars and pulled it loose without any
mercy on the cloth or without any care for the
appearance which she would soon present. She
stopped but once, and then merely to listen.
There was no sound in the woods of any pursuit,
there was scarcely a song of a bird. Again she
plunged on. She did not think of John Baring,
she scarcely thought of Herbert. She was a
desperate creature, who forgets all but the goal,
even the reason for the race.</p>

<p>After a while she stopped again, panting. Her
hair had come unfastened and she braided it as
she waited. Then she listened intently, not now
in terror for sign of pursuit, but in hope of another
sound. She had descended a long distance
and she had kept well to the left. She should hear
before long an automobile horn blown warningly
on the long descent, or the chug, chug of a
machine climbing the hill.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>But as yet there was nothing. She drew a deep
breath and went on. Again she stopped and listened.
She heard no sound, but she saw before
her an open field. She had gone down through
the spur of woods which ran out from the main
forest and in a moment she was in the weedy
fields of John Baring&#8217;s property, the old house
far above her, and in a few moments more she
stood panting by the roadside.</p>

<p>There she waited. She did not walk on toward
Gettysburg, because here on this comparatively
level strip at the foot of a short curve
the drivers would have slackened their speed and
it would be easy for a car to stop. But no car
came. She held her breath as she listened.</p>

<p>When, at last, she heard a distant horn, she
stepped out toward the road. She heard also
laughing voices above the sound of the horn. As
the car came round the curve she lifted her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you take me to Gettysburg?&#8221; she cried.
&#8220;I have&mdash;&#8221; But the riders did not stop to hear
what she had. They were young; it may have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
been that her appearance frightened them. They
did not even answer, but sailed on. One young
man stood up in the car and looked back at her.
Elizabeth shrank against the fence.</p>

<p>Then she heard a different sound, this time
the throb of an engine rapidly climbing the hill.
Here there would be no use to ask. But when the
car came into view, long and low and powerful
and occupied by a man alone, she walked out
into the road.</p>

<p>The driver stopped with a grinding of brakes,
his machine turned a little to one side. It was to
be gathered from his expression that he believed
himself to be halted by a madwoman.</p>

<p>Elizabeth laid her hand across her heart. Consciousness
seemed to be going once more. If he
would not listen she would despair.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not crazy,&#8221; she explained earnestly. &#8220;I
am in great trouble. I tried to get some people
to take me to Gettysburg to get the officers, but
they would not stop. Perhaps if you would wait
here and help me I could get a ride.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>&#8220;What is your trouble?&#8221; asked the man.</p>

<p>Elizabeth could not answer. Her blue eyes
rested upon him in anguish. The stranger called
to her to stand out of the way and began to turn
his car. She watched him incredulously as he
opened the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get in. Where do you want to go in Gettysburg?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to see Colonel Thomas,&#8221; she explained.
Already the car seemed to be leaping
down the hill. &#8220;I live up here and the mountaineers
have threatened to do us harm. They hold
a fancied wrong against us and they have carried
off my brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>The stranger stared. The story was, indeed,
fantastic beyond belief.</p>

<p>&#8220;What mountaineers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re people that have always lived up
here far back in the woods. They&#8217;re outlaws. I
had been warned by them, but I couldn&#8217;t believe
they&#8217;d do what they threatened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whom will Colonel Thomas get to help you?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>&#8220;There are State police in this neighborhood,&#8221;
said Elizabeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said the stranger.</p>

<p>They had reached the level plain, and the machine
seemed to leap into a speed greater than
that at which they had come down the hill.
Elizabeth told, gasping, a few of the details of
her trouble. The stranger glanced at her in amazement,
no longer doubting her sanity. He leaned
over his wheel, watching the road with a trained
eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take the constabulary up,&#8221; he offered.</p>

<small>HERBERT PUTS TWO AND TWO TOGETHER</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Herbert</span> had been in reality left almost without
food for a day. But as he grew weaker, he grew
more determined. Several times Sheldon brought
him the soiled paper and the stub of pencil and
asked him to write. Herbert shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;She ain&#8217;t got help for you very fast,&#8221; growled
Sheldon.</p>

<p>Herbert looked up into the sullen face, seeing
there again a kind of desperation.</p>

<p>On the morning of the second day, when Elizabeth
was traveling toward the cabin, the gaunt,
angular woman called Jinny came to speak to
him. She brought with her a piece of bread.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll sneak you some more,&#8221; she promised.
&#8220;Are you learned?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not very,&#8221; answered Herbert, as he munched
the dry, poor bread.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean can you read and write?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; do sums?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I can do sums.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t get along in the world without
some learnin&#8217;, kin you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not very well,&#8221; answered Herbert.</p>

<p>The woman pointed to the south.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s lots of us, down that-a-way what
ain&#8217;t got no use for learnin&#8217; an&#8217; we&#8217;re dyin&#8217; like
flies with our airless lives. We&#8217;ve got the tisic
an&#8217; the takin&#8217;-off an&#8217; we won&#8217;t listen to no one.
I&#8217;m willin&#8217; to learn an&#8217; to have my children
learn, an&#8217; sometimes one comes to show us the
way, but they get druv off by those that are
against &#8217;em. I tell you the mountain people
don&#8217; know what&#8217;s for their good; they&#8217;re blind
an&#8217; they won&#8217;t see, as the Good Book says.
They&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Jinny was not allowed to finish her speech.
Her husband approached with Black Smith, and
Herbert heard the account of Black Smith&#8217;s
conversation with Elizabeth.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>&#8220;She says if we let her have the boy, she&#8217;ll git
us the paper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s settin&#8217; on a rock. There ain&#8217;t but one
way out for her an&#8217; that&#8217;s the way she come in
an&#8217; John&#8217;s watchin&#8217; that. Let her set.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you hev faith in her that she will keep
her word?&#8221; asked Sheldon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I do. She&#8217;s had two nights an&#8217; a day
now an&#8217; she&#8217;s droppin&#8217; from sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Sheldon looked about uneasily.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sure it ain&#8217;t no trap?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it ain&#8217;t no trap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is the paper?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. She&#8217;ll git it when she sees
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sheldon stood leaning against a tree. Another
man joined them and then another. They were
a formidable group with their long guns, and
with their savage-looking dogs standing alertly
beside them.</p>

<p>&#8220;You bring her to Mammy&#8217;s bedside an&#8217; then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
we&#8217;ll test &#8217;em both,&#8221; commanded Sheldon. &#8220;Go
git her.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the party was not to move. A pleasant
odor of freshly frying ham and of baking johnny-cake
filled the air.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t had no food yet to-day,&#8221; whined
Black Smith. &#8220;I can&#8217;t go too long without
food.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, eat,&#8221; grumbled Sheldon, who,
while he scolded, commanded Jinny to bring
him his own breakfast.</p>

<p>Jinny brought him not only his breakfast, but
advice as well.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have no right to persecute these young
people,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Vengeance is prepared for
you; it were well to meet it with deeds of goodness.
Let &#8217;em go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her husband silenced her with his usual command.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to shet up,&#8221; persisted Jinny.
&#8220;An&#8217; you can&#8217;t make me shet up. I&#8217;ve stood by
ye, but I won&#8217;t stand by ye no longer. We were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
benighted, but we have seen the light. Light is
bein&#8217; let into all sorts o&#8217; dark places these days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shet up, Jinny,&#8221; commanded Sheldon once
more. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t a man to eat his vittles in peace?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Jinny, &#8220;he ain&#8217;t! Keep on an&#8217; them
police in black clothes&#8217;ll git ye soon enough, an&#8217;
then ye can eat in the peace o&#8217; prison.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sheldon rose brushing the plate of food from
his knee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye take my appetite,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Come on,
Smith.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Smith would not obey until he had had
his fill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; he ordered Herbert at last.</p>

<p>Herbert rose, stiff and trembling. Then he sat
down heavily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; commanded Sheldon roughly.
&#8220;We spent enough time foolin&#8217; with you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can they walk who haven&#8217;t et?&#8221; demanded
Jinny. &#8220;When he has had some o&#8217; the
food that tantalizes his senses, then he can walk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Git him some.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>Herbert ate slowly. He did not mean to delay
the start; it seemed a year since he had seen
Elizabeth; but he was afraid to eat rapidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has a delicate stomick,&#8221; said Black
Smith, grinning.</p>

<p>Herbert rose once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can go now,&#8221; said he angrily. &#8220;But I can&#8217;t
go very fast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, go as fast as ye can,&#8221; said Sheldon.
Then he directed Herbert to step out from behind
Smith and take another way. &#8220;You fetch
her,&#8221; said he to Smith. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be there ahead
of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Smith started rapidly, looking forward not
without pleasant anticipation to the moment
when, gun in hand, he should lead Elizabeth to
Mammy Sheldon&#8217;s cabin. It would be not only
another triumph for the mountain people to have
outwitted the people of the plain, but it would
end an anxiety which was really acute. Mammy
Sheldon knew their past history, and there were
incidents which Smith and his friends believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
might get them into serious trouble. Heaven only
knew how much she had told! They would end
her chances for making mischief by moving her
nearer to their own cabins, annoying as was her
constant crying.</p>

<p>Then Smith stopped speculating and stood still.
The rock on which he had left Elizabeth was
bare; she was not there either awake or sleeping.
Under his black beard he grew deathly
white. Then, cursing, he stepped rapidly into
the woods. After a while he returned to the
rock. Elizabeth was still not there. He stepped
out again in a different direction, and this time
he was longer away. When he returned a second
time, he stared with a terror which had ceased
to be intelligent. His journey and his meal had
made his absence long. She could not have gone
to fetch those black-coated police! Some one
would kill him if she had; he knew that, but in
his confusion he was not sure whether it would
be Sheldon or the police. The girl had said that
they could be punished for past crimes. Again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
now without any conscious plan, he plunged into
the woods.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Elizabeth reached the house of Colonel
Thomas, not much more than a quarter of an
hour after she had accosted the stranger on the
roadside, she saw that old gentleman sitting,
as usual, on his porch. As usual, he did not wait
for his visitors to come to him, but rose and
walked to the porch steps. The kindly stranger
bade Elizabeth sit still in the car and went to
meet him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was stopped on the Cashtown road by a
young woman named Elizabeth Scott, who says
that her brother has been carried off into the
mountain. She has come to find you and the
constabulary. My car is at your service, if you
need it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Colonel Thomas said &#8220;Wait!&#8221; and vanished
indoors. His voice could be heard, first shouting
to his family, then into a telephone. When he
reappeared a hat was set rakishly on his head,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
and he was answering over his shoulder protests
of some one indoors.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I&#8217;m going!&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>In another instant his foot was on the car step.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two State police, Garnett and Byers, rode
toward Fairfield not fifteen minutes ago. We
can catch them and there is a cross-road. Why,
Miss Scott, don&#8217;t cry <i>now</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth looked at him tearfully. The great
car was turning; she felt like a child who had
been lost and who sees at last some hope of
rescue.</p>

<p>Within five minutes they had caught up with
the two horsemen who left their mounts at a
farmhouse and got into the machine. The driver
bent a little over his wheel and again they were
off. Before they started to climb the last hill,
Colonel Thomas leaning forward shouted to the
driver to stop.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d better make our plans,&#8221; said he nervously.
His eyes sparkled; one could imagine
how he had looked before going into a charge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
He had had, alas, a letter from the editor of
General Adams&#8217;s &#8220;Recollections,&#8221; who had explained
that the letter from which Colonel
Thomas&#8217;s quotation was taken had been partially
destroyed and that the row of asterisks
indicated a missing sheet. He wished that he
had not mentioned his inquiry to Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Elizabeth recounted hurriedly the history of
the last few days.</p>

<p>&#8220;After you went away, I went down the road
on an errand, and when I came back Herbert
was gone, and there was a notice saying that I
could have him in exchange for the paper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What paper?&#8221; asked Colonel Thomas.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some time ago I walked up into the woods
and heard an old woman crying because her son
was going to take her money to buy a gun and
there wouldn&#8217;t be anything to bury her. Forty
dollars was all she had. So I wrote a will, but I
left it in the cabin, and she won&#8217;t give it to them.
I think they&#8217;re afraid that she told other things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What other things?&#8221; asked one of the police.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, but they&#8217;re afraid of something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I bet they are!&#8221; said Colonel Thomas.</p>

<p>&#8220;This afternoon I was to bring the paper to
the old woman&#8217;s cabin and they were to bring
Herbert. I expect they are there now. Instead
I came to get you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The driver of the car touched a button and
the car moved. Elizabeth indicated the turn
into the wood road above the house. One of the
police leaned forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t you better get out, miss?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; answered Elizabeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you, sir?&#8221; said he to Colonel Thomas.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not!&#8221; said Colonel Thomas.</p>

<p>Each of the constabulary took something
from his hip pocket. Elizabeth looked back at
them smiling in a pale sort of way, and they
smiled at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never you mind, miss; they won&#8217;t give
much trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herbert, sitting at the foot of a tree with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
captors beside him, heard the car first. The mountaineers
stood about, guns in hand, first one,
then another going off toward the spot where
Black Smith was supposed to have left Elizabeth.
More than an hour had passed since he had left
them and there had been no sign of his return.
The crying of Mammy Sheldon was almost continuous;
she seemed to believe that now they
had come to fetch her will. There were moments
when she screamed for fear that they would bury
her as she was. It was no wonder that they did
not hear the car.</p>

<p>Black Smith had heard it, as he hunted frantically,
and he came now running toward them,
shouting. But his shouts were too late. The men
stood mystified, and found themselves covered
by the pistols of their dreaded enemies.</p>

<p>One of the constabulary stepped down.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are covered from the car!&#8221; said he
quietly. &#8220;Put down your guns.&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth tried in vain to move. For an instant
she did not see Herbert. If they had hurt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
him, if they had carried out their threats, then
she hoped that the mountain-side would become
a place of execution.</p>

<p>But Herbert came forward, unrestrained by
his captors. The mountaineers seemed stupefied.
The uniforms, the heavy revolvers, the car&mdash;all
declared a newer and swifter age of retribution.
Jinny was right when she said that light
was about to be let in. They obeyed meekly the
command of the young officer.</p>

<p>Herbert walked directly to the side of the car
and laid his hand on Elizabeth&#8217;s arm. His mind
was filled with one emotion; he scarcely saw
the constabulary or Colonel Thomas; he thought
only that Elizabeth wanted something, and that
he had it to give. He had had much time to
meditate, and he had put two and two together.
He had less persistence than Elizabeth, but he
had more originality of mind. Weak and excited,
he blurted out the words which were uppermost
in his consciousness, and which had been
growing to seem more and more significant.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>&#8220;They said my Grandfather Baring was
buried here. They threatened to put me in the
same grave. They were angry with him. I believe
they shot him here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What! What!&#8221; Colonel Thomas stepped
down from the car. &#8220;He went away with the
Confederates and was never heard of more!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They threatened to put me in the same grave
with him!&#8221; insisted Herbert. &#8220;I believe they
shot him here. If he was friendly to the South
they would not have done that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t hurt you,&#8221; cried a terrified voice.
&#8220;We treated you good!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was war-time!&#8221; cried another. &#8220;Things
is done different in war-time!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who shot him?&#8221; demanded the old gentleman
in a voice of authority.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was before our time,&#8221; came the frightened
answer.</p>

<p>Then a shrill, spent voice spoke from within
the log cabin.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t let me have my forty dollars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
for to bury me, I&#8217;ll tell about John
Baring!&#8221;</p>

<p>The old colonel went with the step of youth
to the tumbledown building. Vague gleams of
light illuminated the confusion in his mind.
What the boy said was true&mdash;if John Baring
had come to his end here, and at these hands, he
was no friend to the enemy! He beckoned to the
police to step nearer to the door. But the old
voice carried to them all.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell about John Baring, if you don&#8217;t let
me have my forty dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What about John Baring?&#8221; asked the old
gentleman. &#8220;I&#8217;ll see that you get your forty
dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old woman was silent. Elizabeth Scott
held her breath. Then the old woman spoke.
Intelligence was almost gone, or she would not
have uttered the betraying words. There was
among them all a conviction that for the crime
of their fathers against John Baring, they might
still be held responsible.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>&#8220;He led &#8217;em in here to deceive &#8217;em!&#8221; she
cried. &#8220;He pretended to help &#8217;em and he deceived
&#8217;em. He led &#8217;em to the wilderness to show &#8217;em
the way to Gettysburg. And our folks led &#8217;em
safely out. Great generals was among &#8217;em an&#8217;
fine men. But it was too late, an&#8217; the battle was
lost. So our folks shot him an&#8217; buried him deep.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old gentleman leaned against the door
frame.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it true?&#8221; he asked of Sheldon and Black
Smith.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was before my time,&#8221; answered Sheldon.</p>

<p>&#8220;But is it true?&#8221;</p>

<p>The men saw prison yawning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Sheldon; &#8220;he lies buried yonder.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Elizabeth sat on her doorstep at twilight. Her
body was weary, but her mind was alert. She had
shown Colonel Thomas the old map and he had
looked at it with tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Slashed it out so they couldn&#8217;t get it, evidently
with the first knife at hand!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>Then Colonel Thomas had gone, his hand
itching for his pen. Relieved of fear of punishment,
Sheldon and his mates had told all they
knew. Their bravado had vanished; they looked
browbeaten and ashamed and even apologized
for using the flag for a target. The constabulary
had given back their guns and had smiled at
Elizabeth&#8217;s gratitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a new age, miss, and they know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Already Elizabeth had had two callers. The
first was the farmer from down the road, who
twisted his hat awkwardly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Colonel Thomas, he stopped at my place,&#8221;
he explained. &#8220;You might think he&#8217;d found a
million dollars. I want to know when your trees
are coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth rose, frightening the farmer, who
thought she was going to be resentful.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to call my brother,&#8221; said she.
&#8220;He&#8217;s the boss of the orchard.&#8221;</p>

<p>While the men talked, Elizabeth sat on the
doorstep, her hands clasped round her knees.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
She smiled into the twilight, remembering with
amusement a narrow escape. It had been on
the tip of her tongue to say, when she had heard
Herbert&#8217;s adventures, &#8220;Darling, weren&#8217;t you
afraid?&#8221; and she had caught herself in time,
realizing that neither &#8220;afraid&#8221; nor &#8220;darling&#8221;
were words to say any more to Herbert.</p>

<p>When the farmer had gone, Elizabeth thought
of a blossoming orchard.</p>

<p>Then a gaunt figure crossed the yard. Elizabeth
had not seen Jinny, but she believed that
this was Jinny before her.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve heard tell that you spoke for us,&#8221;
said a harsh, tired voice. &#8220;You said to every one
assembled at the place of meetin&#8217; this afternoon
that not bein&#8217; trusted makes folks wicked. You
said you was goin&#8217; to trust us. Now you have let
your light shine, miss, don&#8217;t forsake us. There&#8217;s
not many left of us, what with our airless houses
an&#8217; the tisic, but what there is is not so bad as
you might expect. What I ask, miss, is that you
will stand by us.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>&#8220;I will,&#8221; promised Elizabeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;And we by you,&#8221; said Jinny; and was gone.</p>

<p>Elizabeth&#8217;s thoughts, following her, went back
to John Baring, traveling the same dark road.</p>

<p>&#8220;He led &#8217;em here to deceive &#8217;em!&#8221; Mammy
Sheldon&#8217;s shrill old voice had cried.</p>

<p>She saw him again standing in his doorway.
She saw the moonlight and the torchlight and
the horsemen, and heard the rumbling guns.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was putting his brave head into a noose,&#8221;
said Elizabeth. Then she remembered the cry of
the old woman on the side road. &#8220;Why, you&#8217;re
his image!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad of that!&#8221; said Elizabeth to herself.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
